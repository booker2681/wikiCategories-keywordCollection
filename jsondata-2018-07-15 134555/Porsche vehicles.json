{"9ff GT9": "The 9ff GT9 is a sports car based loosely on the Porsche 911,[2] built by German tuning company 9ff, founded by Jan Fatthauer. Based on the Porsche 911 (997) GT3; the cars are extensively rebuilt and fitted with a heavily modified 3.6-4.0 litre flat 6 engine that produces 738 to 1,120\u00a0bhp (550 to 835\u00a0kW; 748 to 1,136\u00a0PS), depending on the configuration.[3] One of the major differences from a normal 911 is the positioning of the engine; whilst every 911 throughout Porsche's history (excluding the Porsche 911 GT1 race car) has been rear-engined, the GT9 is mid-engined for better weight distribution.\nIt takes the 9ff 3.8 seconds (from a rolling start) or 5.2 seconds (from a standing start) to reach 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), and 17.6 seconds to reach 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[4] The top speed of the original GT9 is 409\u00a0km/h (254\u00a0mph).[3][5] This was faster than the original Bugatti Veyron, but slower than both the SSC Ultimate Aero TT and the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.\nThe interior of the car has been stripped out for lightness and thus was very basic compared to a standard 911 GT3. All GT9s had blue leather, square patterned interior trim, with a roll cage for safety. A carbon fibre and kevlar construction helps further in weight savings.\n9ff stated that only 150 GT9s would be produced, and only 20 of those would have the most powerful engine. Prices ranged between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3540,000 depending on engine and options,[5] with all of them already sold by the time the car was launched in the market.\nThe GT9-R was a high performance variant of the GT9, offering up to 1,120\u00a0bhp (840\u00a0kW; 1,140\u00a0PS) from a 4.0L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine. It was designed to take the speed record for a street legal car from the Bugatti Veyron, with a claimed speed of 420\u00a0km/h (260\u00a0mph), although this was never tested.[3]\nIt accelerates from 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 2.9s and 0\u2013300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) in under 16s.[6] Only 20 examples of the GT9-R were produced.[3]\nAt the 2011 Essen Motor Show, 9ff brought out the third version of the car, the GT9-CS, built as a one-off.[7] This car used the Stage 1 3.6L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine, thus producing 738\u00a0bhp (550\u00a0kW; 748\u00a0PS),[8] and was designed specifically as a track-day car. A further 86\u00a0kg (190\u00a0lb) of weight was removed from the car, and several changes were made - a new rear wing, front splitter, and revised air intakes.[9]\n", "Porsche 64": "The Porsche 64, also known as the Type 64 and Type 60K10, is considered by many to be the first automobile from what was to become the Porsche company, and a true design precursor to the post-war production model. The model number comes from the fact that it was built mainly from design drawings for the Type-64 \"record car\". Most mechanical parts came from the 38 prototype series.  The chassis was heavily reinforced and the engine also reworked to produce around 40 horse power.[1] The Type-64 was only a drawing until the three racers were built.  The body was also a compromise in that the cab had to look like a KdF car[citation needed], but the rest was 'record' car.  The VW beetle was the Type-60, and the name the \"60K10\" means body design 10 for the Type-60 Beetle. Its flat-four engine produced 50 bhp and gave a top speed of around 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph).\nThe body design was made by the Porsche B\u00fcro after wind tunnel tests for a planned V10 sports car that never came into existence, the Type 114. Dr. Porsche promoted the idea to enter the car into the 1939 Berlin-Rome race as a public relations ploy. Three cars were made in hand shaped aluminium by the bodywork company Reutter. One was destroyed  early in World War II. The two remaining were used by the Porsche family.[citation needed] Eventually they only used one of them and put the other in storage.[citation needed]\nIn May 1945 American troops discovered the one put in storage, cut the roof off and used it for joyriding for a few weeks until the engine gave up and it was scrapped. The last remaining Porsche 64 was owned by Ferry Porsche who had it restored by Battista Farina in 1947. In 1949 it was sold to the Austrian motorcycle racer Otto Math\u00e9 and with it he won the Alpine Rally in 1950. The last time he drove it in a race was at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in Monterey, California, in 1982.[citation needed] The one that was scrapped has also been rebuilt and is now on display in the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, CA, shown on MotorWeek S37 Ep32 on 4/13/18.[2]\n", "Porsche-Diesel 218": "The Porsche-Diesel Standard 218, also known as N 218 is the third generation of the two cylinder Standard tractor model series manufactured by Porsche-Diesel Motorenbau GmbH in Friedrichshafen am Bodensee. The Standard 218 was produced in four different variations. It succeeded its predecessor, the Porsche-Diesel 208 in 1957. From 1957 to 1963 the Porsche plant produced more than 12,000 Standard 218 tractors.[1]\nThe tractor is built using a frameless block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668\u00a0mm.[1] The track of the front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis.[1] The internal expanding brake brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a steering brake.[1] The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen.[1] All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a six gear gearbox with a crawler gear.[1] The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch.[1] Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550\u00a0kg[1] The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM\u00a0500.[1] The weight of the tractor is 1625\u00a0kg including the three-point-linkage, the mower bar and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims.[1] The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.[2]\nFour different models of the Porsche 218 have been produced:\nThe Porsche-Diesel Standard 218 has the Porsche F\u00a0218 engine, an air-cooled two cylinder four stroke diesel engine with swirl chamber injection. Unlike its predecessor Porsche Nr. 2066, the Porsche F\u00a0218 has an aluminum crankcase instead of a cast iron crankcase.[3] Bore and stroke of the engine are 95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0116\u00a0mm,[2] the displacement is 1644\u00a0cm\u00b3.[2] The engine housing consists of two parts. The crankshaft with balance weights bolted onto, the conrods, the in-line injection pump by Bosch and the aluminum valve pushrods have been taken from the Porsche Nr. 2066 engine.[3] It has a radial cooling fan. The crankshaft has three bearings.[4] A pressure lubrication lubricates the engine, the air is cleaned by an oil-bath air cleaner.[4] The overhead valves are driven by a gear driven camshaft. Each piston has five piston rings.[4] The Flywheel has a radius of 40\u00a0cm.[2] At 2000\u00a0min\u22121 the engine produces a power of 18,4\u00a0kW[4] and delivers a torque of 88\u00a0N\u00b7m.[4] The maximum torque of 91\u00a0N\u00b7m is served up at 1800\u00a0min\u22121.[4] The minimum compression of the engine must be 18,6\u00a0bar,[4] the compression ratio is 19:1.[4] The fuel injetion pressure is 147\u00a0bar.[2] The cetane number of the fuel must not be fewer than 44.[2]\nNameplate of a V-Model, 1959\nPorsche-Diesel Standard U 218, 1958\nPorsche-Diesel Standard 218 in the Porsche-Museum\nDashboard of the Porsche-Diesel 218\nBack of the tractor: Towing hook and linkage.

F. Porsche GmbH (1950\u20131965). It was Porsche's first production automobile. Earlier cars designed by the Austrian company include Cisitalia Grand Prix race car, the Volkswagen Beetle, and Auto Union Grand Prix cars.\nThe 356 is a lightweight and nimble-handling, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door available both in hardtop coup\u00e9 and open configurations. Engineering innovations continued during the years of manufacture, contributing to its motorsports success and popularity. Production started in 1948 at Gm\u00fcnd, Austria, where approximately 50 cars were built. In 1950 the factory relocated to Zuffenhausen, Germany, and general production of the 356 continued until April 1965, well after the replacement model 911 made its autumn 1963 debut. Of the 76,000 originally produced, approximately half survive.[1]\nThe original price in 1948 for the 356 coupe was US$3,750.  The 356 cabriolet cost US$4,250.  [2]\nPrior to World War II Porsche designed and built three Type 64 cars for a 1939 Berlin-to-Rome race that was cancelled. In 1948 the mid-engine,[3] tubular chassis 356 prototype called \"No. 1\" was completed. This led to some debate as to the \"first\" Porsche automobile, but the 356 is considered by Porsche to be its first production model.[1][4]\nThe 356 was created by Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche (son of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of the German company), who founded the Austrian company with his sister, Louise. Like its cousin, the Volkswagen Beetle (which Ferdinand Porsche Sr. had designed), the 356 is a four-cylinder, air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive car with unitized pan and body construction. The chassis was a completely new design as was the 356's body which was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda, while certain mechanical components including the engine case and some suspension components were based on and initially sourced from Volkswagen. Ferry Porsche described the thinking behind the development of the 356 in an interview with the editor of Panorama, the PCA magazine, in September 1972. \"...I had always driven very speedy cars. I had an Alfa Romeo, also a BMW and others. \u2026.By the end of the war I had a Volkswagen Cabriolet with a supercharged engine and that was the basic idea. I saw that if you had enough power in a small car it is nicer to drive than if you have a big car which is also overpowered. And it is more fun. On this basic idea we started the first Porsche prototype. To make the car lighter, to have an engine with more horsepower\u2026that was the first two seater that we built in Carinthia (Gm\u00fcnd)\". \nThe first 356 was road certified in Austria on June 8, 1948, and was entered in a race in Innsbruck where it won its class.[6] Porsche re-engineered and refined the car with a focus on performance.  Fewer and fewer parts were shared between Volkswagen and Porsche as the 1950s progressed. The early 356 automobile bodies produced at Gm\u00fcnd were handcrafted in aluminum, but when production moved to Zuffenhausen, Germany in 1950, models produced there were steel-bodied. The aluminium bodied cars from that very small company are what are now referred to as \"prototypes\". Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually bought the Reutter company in 1963.[7] The Reutter company retained the seat manufacturing part of the business and changed its name to \"Recaro\".\nLittle noticed at its inception, mostly by a small number of auto racing enthusiasts, the first 356s sold primarily in Austria and Germany. It took Porsche two years, starting with the first prototype in 1948, to manufacture the first 50 automobiles. By the early 1950s the 356 had gained some renown among enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic for its aerodynamics, handling, and excellent build quality. The class win at Le Mans in 1951 was a factor.[8] It was common for owners to race the car as well as drive them on the streets. They introduced the four-cam racing \"Carrera\" engine, a totally new design and unique to Porsche sports cars, in late 1954. Increasing success with its racing and road cars brought Porsche orders for over 10,000 units in 1964, and by the time 356 production ended in 1965 approximately 76,000 had been produced.[1]\nThe 356 was built in four distinct series, the original (\"pre-A\"), followed by the 356\u00a0A, 356\u00a0B, and finally the 356\u00a0C. To distinguish among the major revisions of the model, 356s are generally classified into a few major groups. The 356 coup\u00e9s and \"cabriolets\" (soft-tops) built through 1955 are readily identifiable by their split (1948 to 1952) or bent (centre-creased, 1953 to 1955) windscreens. In late 1955 the 356\u00a0A appeared, with a curved windshield. The A was the first road going Porsche to offer the Carrera four-cam engine as an option. In late 1959 the T5 356\u00a0B appeared; followed by the redesigned T6 series 356\u00a0B in 1962. The final version was the 356\u00a0C, little changed from the late T6 B cars but disc brakes replaced the drums.\nPrior to completion of 356 production, Porsche had developed a higher-revving 616/36 version of the 356's four-cylinder pushrod engine for installation in a new 912 model that commenced production in April 1965.  Although the 912 used numerous 356 components,  Porsche did not intended for the 912 to replace the 356.\nWhen the decision was made to replace the 356, the 901 (later 911) was the road car designed to carry the Porsche name forward.  The 912 was developed as the \"standard version\" of the 911 at the 17,500DM price of a 356 1600 SC, while the complex but faster and heavier six-cylinder 911 was priced more than fifty percent higher.[9]  Customers purchased nearly 33,000 912 coup\u00e9s and Targas powered by the Type 616 engine that had served Porsche so well during the 356 era.\n356 No. 1 (mid-engine prototype)\n1948 coup\u00e9 at the Porsche-Museum\nFour views\n356 engine layout shows VW ancestry\nFrom the earliest, 1,100\u00a0cc Gm\u00fcnd beginnings, the overall shape of the 356 remained more or less set. In 1951, 1,300 and 1,500\u00a0cc engines with considerably more power were introduced. By late 1952 the divided windscreen was gone, replaced by a V-shaped unit which fit into the same opening. In 1953, the 1300 S or \"Super\" was introduced, and the 1,100\u00a0cc engine was dropped. In late-1954 Max Hoffman, the sole US importer of Porsches, convinced Porsche to build a stripped down roadster version with minimal equipment and a cut-down windscreen. Towards the end of the original 356's time (in 1955, when the 356\u00a0A was about to be introduced) Hoffman, wanting a model name rather than just a number, got the factory to use the name \"Continental\" which was applied mostly to cars sold in the United States. Ford, makers of the Lincoln Continental, sued.[10] This name was used only in 1955 and today this version is especially valued. For 1956, the equivalent version was briefly sold as the \"European\".[10] Today all of the earliest Porsches are highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts worldwide based on their design, reliability and sporting performance.\nIn late 1955, with numerous small but significant changes, the 356\u00a0A was introduced. Its internal factory designation, \"Type 1\", gave rise to its nickname \"T1\" among enthusiasts. In the US 1,200 early 356s had been badged as the \"Continental\" and then a further 156 from autumn 1955 to January 1956 as an even rarer T1 \u201cEuropean\u201d variant after which it reverted to its numerical 356 designation. In early 1957 a second revision of the 356\u00a0A was produced, known as Type 2 (or T2). Production of the Speedster peaked at 1,171 cars in 1957 and then started to decline. The four-cam \"Carrera\" engine, initially available only in the spyder race cars, became an available option starting with the 356\u00a0A.\nWithin the last 25 years, replicas of the 356 A have become very popular.\nMost typical engine was a 1,582\u00a0cc (1.6\u00a0L; 96.5\u00a0cu\u00a0in) 4-cylinder boxer air-cooled naturally aspirated Pushrod OHV 2 valves per cylinder valvetrain, with dual downdraft Zenith carburetors, producing 60\u00a0PS (59\u00a0hp; 44\u00a0kW) @ 4500 rpm and a maximum torque of 110\u00a0N\u22c5m (81\u00a0lb\u22c5ft; 11\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 2800 rpm [11] [12].\nIn late 1959 significant styling and technical refinements gave rise to the 356\u00a0B (a T5 body type). The mid-1962 356\u00a0B model was changed to the T6 body type (twin engine lid grilles, an external fuel filler in the right front wing/fender and a larger rear window in the coup\u00e9). The Porsche factory did not call attention to these quite visible changes with a different model designation. However, when the T6 got disc brakes, with no other visible alterations, they called it the model C, or the SC when it had the optional extra powerful engine. A unique \"Karmann hardtop\" or \"notchback\" 356\u00a0B model was produced in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 production run (T5) was essentially a cabriolet body with the optional steel cabriolet hardtop welded in place. The 1962 line (T6 production) was a very different design in that the new T6 notchback coup\u00e9 body did not start life as a cabriolet, but with its own production design\u2014In essence, part cabriolet rear end design, part T6 coup\u00e9 windshield frame, unique hard top. Both years of these unique cars have taken the name \"Karmann notchback\".[13]\nThe last revision of the 356 was the 356\u00a0C introduced for the 1964 model year. It featured disc brakes all around, as well as an option for the most powerful pushrod engine Porsche had ever produced, the 95\u00a0hp (71\u00a0kW) \"SC\". Production of the 356 peaked at 14,151 cars in 1964, the year that its successor, the new 911, was introduced to the US market (it was introduced slightly earlier in Europe). The company continued to sell the 356\u00a0C in North America through 1965 as demand for the model remained quite strong in the early days of the heavier and more \"civilized\" 911. The last ten 356s (cabriolets) were assembled for the Dutch police force in March 1966 as 1965 models.[14]\nThe 356 originated as a coup\u00e9 only 1948-1955.  Over time a variety of other styles appeared, including roadster, convertible, cabriolet, and a very rare split-roof.[clarification needed]\nThe basic design of the 356 remained the same throughout the end of its lifespan in 1965, with evolutionary, functional improvements rather than annual superficial styling changes. \nThe car was built of a unibody construction, making restoration difficult for cars that were kept in rust-prone climates.  One of the most desirable collector models is the 356 \"Speedster\", introduced in late 1954 after Max Hoffman advised the company that a lower-cost, somewhat spartan open-top version could sell well in the American market. With its low, raked windscreen (which could be removed for weekend racing), bucket seats and minimal folding top, the Speedster was an instant hit, especially in Southern California.\nIt was replaced in late 1958 by the \"convertible D\" model.[15] It featured a taller, more practical windshield (allowing improved headroom with the top erected), roll-up glass side-windows and more comfortable seats. The following year the 356\u00a0B \"roadster\" convertible replaced the D model but the sports car market's love affair with top-down motoring was fading; soft-top 356 model sales declined significantly in the early 1960s.\nCabriolet models (convertibles with a full windshield and padded top) were offered from the start, and in the early 1950s sometimes comprised over 50% of total production. A unique \"Karmann hardtop\" or \"notchback\" 356\u00a0B model was produced in 1961 and 1962, essentially a cabriolet-style body with a permanent metal roof.\nPorsche designers decided to build the 356's air-cooled pushrod OHV flat-four around the engine case they had originally designed for the Volkswagen Beetle. They added new cylinder heads, camshaft, crankshaft, intake and exhaust manifolds and used dual carburetors to more than double the VW's horsepower. While the first prototype 356 had a mid-engine layout, all subsequent 356 engines were rear-mounted. The four-cam \"Carrera\" engine appeared in late 1955 as an extra cost option on the 356\u00a0A, and remained available through the 356 model run.\nThe 356 has always been popular with the motor press. In 2004, Sports Car International ranked the 356\u00a0C tenth on their list of top sports cars of the 1960s. It remains a highly regarded collector car, regularly bringing between US$20,000 and well over US$100,000 at auction.[citation needed] The limited production Carrera Speedster (with its special DOHC racing engine), SC, Super 90 and Speedster models are among the most desirable. A fully restored Carrera (of which only about 140 were made) can sell for around $300,000 at auction.[citation needed]\nThousands of owners worldwide maintain the 356 tradition, preserving their cars and driving them regularly. The U.S.-based 356 Registry's website states calls it, \"[W]orld's largest classic Porsche club.\"\nThe 356 Speedster is among the most frequently reproduced classic automobiles.[citation needed]\nSeveral companies build near-exact replicas from the ground up, fabricating turn-key cars to the buyer's exact specifications.[citation needed]\nThe Porsche 356, close to stock or highly modified, has enjoyed much success in rallying and car racing events.\nSeveral Porsche 356s were stripped down in weight, and were modified in order to have better performance and handling for these races. A few notable examples include the Porsche 356 SL, and the Porsche 356\u00a0A Carrera GT.\nIn the early 1960s Porsche collaborated with Abarth and built the Porsche 356\u00a0B Carrera GTL Abarth coup\u00e9, which enjoyed some success in motor sports.\nRace-prepared 1959 356\u00a0A\nPorsche 356\u00a0B Carrera GTL-Abarth\nPorsche 356\u00a0B 1600 GS-GT (Dreikantschaber) G\u00fcnter Klass/Sepp Greger, N\u00fcrburgring 1964\nNumber 53456, the first 356 Carrera ever produced (a modified 3 May, 1955 exemplar owned by Porsche engineer Reinhard Schmidt as first owner), was analyzed in February 2018 by Quattroruote's subsidiary Ruoteclassiche[16]. It was estimated that its price was about \u20ac 335000.\nA black Porsche 356 A features in the manga and anime series Case Closed, as a personal car infamously owned by Gin, one of the main antagonists of the series. Another Porsche 356 A also features in the case \"The Four Porsches\" of the same series.\n", "Porsche 356/1": "The Porsche 356/1 was the first real Porsche car created by Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche. This prototype car was a two-seater open roadster with a mid-mounted, air-cooled flat-4 engine of 1,131 cc displacement that produced 40 horsepower (30\u00a0kW). While the body was an original design, most of the mechanicals (including engine and suspension) were derived from the Volkswagen Beetle which Ferry's father, Ferdinand Porsche, had designed. \nThe aluminum roadster body of the 356/1 was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda in April 1948 at Gm\u00fcnd and completed only a month later. Smooth and low, the 356/1 set the pattern for later 356s with one fundamental difference; the engine of the production cars was moved behind the rear axle (to reduce costs and make room for two additional seats). The car was registered by the state of Carinthia (K\u00e4rnten) with the license plate K45-286 and made its maiden voyage on June 8, 1948.\nOnly one 356/1 was made and it is on display at the Porsche Museum, Stuttgart.\n", "Cisitalia Grand Prix": "The Cisitalia Grand Prix is a single-seater car for the postwar 1.5-litre supercharged Grand Prix class, built by Italian sports car manufacturer Cisitalia and introduced in 1949. It was designed on behalf of Cisitalia by Porsche between 1946\u201347, and is therefore also known by its Porsche project number, Typ 360.\nAn extremely advanced design, it proved too complex to build for the small Italian firm\u2014leading to a lengthy development and eventually to the financial downfall of the company. Between Cisitalia's 1949 liquidation and the fact that supercharged engines were banned for the 1952 Formula One season, the car never raced.\nThe car was commissioned by Piero Dusio in 1946. Dusio paid a large sum of money up front, part of which was used to free Ferdinand Porsche from the French prison in which he was being held effectively for ransom.  Dusio gave Porsche only 16 months to complete the car which proved too short a time to sort out the advanced design.\nThe Dr. Porsche designed unraced 1939 1,482.56 cc (53.0 x 56.0\u00a0mm) 2-stage Roots supercharged flat-12 Auto-Union had been projected to deliver 327\u00a0bhp (244\u00a0kW) at 9,000 rpm. This provided the basis of the Cisitalia 360 car which was built in Italy by Cisitalia personnel with help from former Porsche employee Robert Eberan von Eberhorst [1] around a mid mounted supercharged 1,492.58 cc (56.0 x 50.5\u00a0mm) flat 12 engine giving a conservative 300\u00a0hp (224\u00a0kW) at 8,500 rpm and a top speed of 300\u00a0km/h (186\u00a0mph). A fully enclosed streamlined body for fast circuits was planned giving over 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h). Later bench tests showed about 385\u00a0bhp (287\u00a0kW) at 10,500 rpm. The chassis was of chromoly tubing and featured on/off four wheel drive with a sequential gear-shift and a rear-mounted transaxle also sending power through a driveshaft to a front differential.  Suspension was trailing arm in front De Dion tube in the rear.  Porsche's experience with the pre-war Auto Union Grand Prix cars showed through in the layout and design of the Cisitalia to the extent that it has been referred to as the \"E Type\".\nBy the time the only prototype was finished Dusio was out of cash.  The car languished in development until 1951, at one point being shipped off to Argentina to try to persuade president Juan Per\u00f3n to invest in the company.  By 1952 Formula One rules had changed and while Dusio attempted to source a 2-liter motor for the car a lack of funds relegated one of the most advanced Grand Prix cars of its day to a few Formula Libre events and quick retirement.  The car is currently on display in the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart.\n", "Porsche 550": "The Porsche 550 was a racing sports car produced by Porsche from 1953-1956.\nThe Type 550/550 A is powered by an all aluminum 1,498\u00a0cc (1.5\u00a0L; 91.4\u00a0cu\u00a0in) naturally aspirated aircooled 4 cylinder boxer engine known as the \"Fuhrmann Engine\" (Type 547).[1] It uses four camshafts (two on each side) driven by vertical shafts, so the valvetrain configuration is DOHC with 2 valves per cylinder, equipped with twin 2-barrel Solex PJJ carburetors and dual ignition with two separate ignition manifolds and two ignition coils as well as two double fall gasifiers. In its first version produced 110\u00a0PS (108\u00a0hp; 81\u00a0kW) @ 6200 rpm and a maximum torque of 121\u00a0N\u22c5m (89\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 5000 rpm [2] [3] [4] [5].\nThe engine of the 550 is mounted in front of the rear axle making it mid-engined. This gives it a more balanced weight distribution, and allows for largely neutral handling. On the other hand, the low mass moment of inertia about the vehicle's vertical axis can lead to a sudden, difficult to control rotation of the car. Porsche used this design principle already in the Grand Prix car of the Auto Union in the late 1930s. \nThe first 550 had a fully synchronized 4-speed gearbox. Starting in 1956, a five-speed gearbox was used, but its first gear only had to start and (like the reverse gear) had to be placed over a barrier and not synchronized. Excessive slip on the drive wheels in corners prevented a limited slip differential.[6]\nInspired by the Porsche 356 which was created by Ferry Porsche, as well as spyder prototypes built and raced by Walter Gl\u00f6ckler starting in 1951, the factory decided to build a car designed for use in auto racing.[7] The Porsche 550 Spyder was introduced at the 1953 Paris Auto Show.[8] The 550 was very low to the ground, in order to be efficient for racing. In fact, former German Formula One racer Hans Herrmann drove it under closed railroad crossing gates during the 1954 Mille Miglia.\nThe first three hand built prototypes came in a coup\u00e9 with a removable hardtop. The first (550-03) raced as a roadster at the Nurburgring Eifel Race in May 1953 winning its first race. Over the next couple of years, the Werks Porsche team evolved and raced the 550 with outstanding success and was recognized wherever it appeared. The Werks cars were provided with differently painted tail fins to aid recognition from the pits. Hans Herrmann\u2019s particularly famous \u2018red-tail\u2019 car No 41 went from victory to victory. Porsche was the first car manufacturer to get race sponsorship which was through Fletcher Aviation, who Porsche was working with to design a light aircraft engine and then later adding Telefunken and Castrol.\nFor such a limited number of 90 prototype and customer builds, the 550 Spyder was always in a winning position, usually finishing in the top three results in its class. The beauty of the 550 was that it could be driven to the track, raced and then driven home, which showed the flexibility of being both a road and track car. Each Spyder was individually designed and customised to be raced and although from the pits it was difficult to identify the sometimes six 550s in the race, the aid of colouring tail spears along the rear wheel fenders, enabled the teams to see their cars. The racing Spyders were predominantly silver in colour, similar to the factory colour of the Mercedes, but there were other splashes of blue, red, yellow and green in the tail spears making up the Porsche palette on the circuit.\nEach Spyder was assigned a number for the race and had gumballs positioned on doors, front and rear, to be seen from any angle. On some 550s owned by privateers, a crude hand written number scrawled in house paint usually served the purpose. Cars with high numbers assigned such as 351, raced in the 1000 mile Mille Miglia, where the number represented the start time of 3.51am. On most occasions, numbers on each Spyder would change for each race entered, which today helps identify each 550 by chassis number and driver in period black and white photos.\nThe later 1956 evolution version of the model, the 550A, which had a lighter and more rigid spaceframe chassis, gave Porsche its first overall win in a major sports car racing event, the 1956 Targa Florio.\nIts successor from 1957 onwards, the Porsche 718, commonly known as the RSK was even more successful. The Spyder variations continued through the early 1960s, the RS 60 and RS 61. A descendant of the Porsche 550 is generally considered to be the Porsche Boxster S 550 Spyder; the Spyder name was effectively resurrected with the RS Spyder Le Mans Prototype.\nPerhaps the most famous of the first 90 Porsche 550s built was James Dean's \"Little Bastard\", numbered 130 (VIN 550-0055), which Dean fatally crashed into Donald Turnupseed's 1950 Ford Custom at the CA Rte. 46/41 Cholame Junction on September 30, 1955.[9]\nAs Dean was finishing up Giant\u2019s filming in September, 1955, he suddenly traded in his 356 Porsche Super Speedster at Competition Motors, for a new 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder on September 21st, and immediately entered the upcoming Salinas Road Race event scheduled for October 1 and 2.[10]\n\nAccording to Lee Raskin, Porsche historian and author of James Dean At Speed, Dean asked custom car painter and pin striper Dean Jeffries to paint \"Little Bastard\" on the car:Dean Jeffries, who had a paint shop next to [George] Barris did the customizing work which consisted of: painting '130' in black non-permanent paint on the front hood, doors and rear deck lid. He also painted 'Little Bastard' in script across the rear cowling. The red leather bucket seats and red tail stripes were original. The tail stripes were painted by the Stuttgart factory, which was customary on the Spyders for long distance endurance racing identification.[11]Purportedly, James Dean had been nicknamed \"Little Bastard\" by Bill Hickman, a Warner Bros. stunt driver who became friendly with him. (Previous references to Hickman say he was Dean's dialogue coach on Giant, though Bob Hinkle, a Texan, was actually Dean's Giant dialogue coach.) Hickman was part of Dean's group driving to the Salinas Road Races on September 30, 1955. Hickman says he called Dean, \"Little Bastard\", and Dean called Hickman, \"Big Bastard.\"\nAnother origin story of the \"Little Bastard\" monicker has been corroborated by two of Dean's close friends, Lew Bracker and photographer Phil Stern. They believe Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. had once referred to Dean as a \"little bastard\" after Dean refused to vacate his temporary East of Eden trailer on the studio's lot, and Dean wanted to get \"even\" with Warner by naming his race car \"Little Bastard\" and to show Warner that despite his sports car racing ban during all filming, Dean was going to be racing the \"Little Bastard\" in between making movies for Warner Bros.[12]\nThe 550 is among the most frequently reproduced classic automobiles. [13]\nSeveral companies have sprung up in the last 25 years that offer kit and turnkey cars, including:\n\nA few other companies build near-exact replicas from the ground up, fabricating 550 turn-key cars to the buyer's exact specifications, including:\n", "Porsche 597": "The Porsche 597 Jagdwagen (roughly translated as \"hunting car\") was a light military vehicle, designed to cover approximately the same remit as the Jeep, K\u00fcbelwagen and Land-Rover. \nOriginally developed as a prototype for a tender to the German Army after World War II, the car never reached mass production after the DKW Munga was chosen over it for reasons of economics.\nThe car was propelled by an induced air-cooled flat-four taken from the Porsche 356, located in the rear of the vehicle like the VWs and Porsches of the period; first in an amended version of the 1.5 litre, with a later bump to 1.6 in the l-model. This engine had an output of around 37\u00a0kW (50 HP). Together with a vehicle weight of 990 kilograms a maximum speed of around 100 kilometers per hour could be achieved. For transmission, a 5-speed manual box with additional on-the-fly two/four wheel drive shifter was provided. With its short wheelbase of 2,060\u00a0mm, the vehicle had the ability to climb steep grades of up to 65%.\nThe prototype body of the car was manufactured by Porsche's own Stuttgart Body Works with later versions (stabilized with torsion bars) coming from Karmann coachworks. The monocoque shell came with no doors and high sills, meaning passengers needed to climb over them to enter and exit the vehicle; The upside of this design being that the body was buoyant and amphibious. Later versions of the body came with rigid doors and exhibit a more steeply dropping angle to the front wings/fenders and bonnet\u2013hood. \nThe Porsche 597 'Hunting Car', alongside the Goliath Type 31 (by the German Federal Armed Forces) were never commissioned for mass production, since, (in the case of the 597), the production costs were too high and the company could not easily supply the sheer numbers of units needed in proposed timescale. Instead the Auto-Union-built DKW Munga model won out for its relative simplicity, lower cost and Auto Union's ability to meet the Army's demand.\nA total of 71 Porsche 597s were manufactured, between 1955 and 1958, 49 of which were built for the civilian market (chassis numbers starting from 597-000101). Development costs for the vehicle amounted to approximately 1.8 million DM. In August 1959 there were still hopes within the Porsche company to produce an updated vehicle based on the 597 platform with a strengthened chassis, extended wheelbase of 2,400mm that could be made available in five different body-styles.  However, the project was eventually cancelled, and the new vehicle never saw the light of day.\n Media related to Porsche 597 at Wikimedia Commons\n", "Porsche 901": "Porsche 901 was the name originally intended for the Porsche 911.\nBy the early 1960s, Porsche project design numbers had reached into the 800s. For instance, Porsche's 1962 F1 model was called Porsche 804.\nAt the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (Frankfurt Motor Show) in Frankfurt in September 1963, Porsche presented its successor to the Porsche 356 as the 901. It took several more months until the cars were manufactured for sale to customers. Between 14 September and 16 November 1964, 82 cars were built[1] and the 901 was presented in October at the 1964 Paris Auto Salon. There, French car maker Peugeot objected to Porsche using any three digit number where the middle number was 0, asserting ownership of the naming rights in key markets, and having already sold many models with that scheme.\nSo, Porsche simply replaced the middle 0 with a 1, and called the car Porsche 911. Officially the 901s already constructed were used for testing and for exhibitions, and Porsche sold none to private customers.[1] Nevertheless, several of the cars retained by Porsche at that time appear to have made it to private ownership subsequently: in 1988 number 20 was discovered and completely restored by Kurt Schneider and his wife, Lori.[2] Then in 2010 it was reported that car number 37 was owned by a Porsche specialist named Alois Ruf.[1]\nAlso, other Porsche models were affected, which were primarily intended for racing but also sold as road legal cars. Here, Porsche kept the internal part number of 90x, but sold the car with a name, like\nPorsche enthusiasts continue to refer to these cars by their three digit design numbers.\nLater, Porsche introduced pure racing cars which were not sold for road use, so not competing with any road-going Peugeot. These carried the design numbers\nAdditionally, the 901 number is used among Porsche enthusiasts as shorthand to identify the aluminum five-speed transmission used in early 911s, the part number for these transmissions used an 11 digit code that began with 901 as did many other parts on the early cars. Later 911s from 1969 used a different magnesium case and a part number beginning with 911.\n", "Porsche 911": "\nThe Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelfer) is a two-door, 2+2 high performance rear-engined classic German sports car made since 1963[1] by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted six cylinder boxer engine and all round independent suspension. It has undergone continuous development, though the basic concept has remained unchanged.[2] The engines were air-cooled until the introduction of the Type 996 in 1998, with Porsche's \"993\" series, produced in model years 1994\u20131998, being the last of the air-cooled Porsches.[3][4]\nThe 911 has been modified by private teams and by the factory itself for racing, rallying, and other forms of automotive competition. It is among the most successful competition cars. In the mid-1970s, naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSRs won major world championship sports car races, such as Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Daytona, even against prototypes. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979 and Porsche won World Championship for Makes titles in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 with 911-derived models.\nIn the 1999 international poll to determine the Car of the Century, the 911 came fifth.[5] It is one of two in the top five that had remained continuously in production (the original Beetle remained in production until 2003),[6] and was until 1998 a successful surviving application of the air- (now water-) cooled opposed rear-engine layout pioneered by its ancestor, the Porsche 356. It is one of the oldest sports coup\u00e9 nameplates still in production with one million manufactured as of May 2017.[7]\nAlthough Porsche changes the internal codes for its models, all 911 models were and are currently sold as a \"911\". The headings below use Porsche's internal classifications.\nThe series letter is used by Porsche to indicate the revision for production cars. It often changes annually to reflect changes for the new model year.\nNot all of the Porsche 911 models produced are mentioned here. The listed models are notable for their role in the advancements in technology and their influence on other vehicles from Porsche.\nThe 911 traces its roots to sketches drawn by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche in 1959.[8] The Porsche 911 was developed as a more powerful, larger and a more comfortable replacement for the Porsche 356, the company's first model. The new car made its public debut at the 1963[1] Frankfurt Motor Show (German: Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung).[9] The car was developed with the proof-of-concept twin-fan Type 745 flat-six engine, but the car presented at the auto show had a non-operational mockup of the single-fan 901 engine, receiving a working unit in February 1964.[8]\nIt originally was designated as the \"Porsche 901\" (901 being its internal project number). A total of 82 cars were built as 901s.[8] However, Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. Instead of selling the new model with a different name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. Internally, the cars' part numbers carried on the prefix 901 for years.[8] Production began in September 1964,[9] with the first 911s marketed to the US in February 1965.[8]\nThe first editions of the 911 had a rear-mounted 130\u00a0PS (96\u00a0kW; 130\u00a0hp)[1] Type 901/01 flat-6 engine, in the \"boxer\" configuration like the 356, air-cooled displacing 1,991\u00a0cc (2.0\u00a0L) compared with the 356's four-cylinder, 1,582\u00a0cc (1.6\u00a0L) unit. The car had four seats although the rear seats were small, thus it is usually called a 2+2 rather than a four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). A four or five-speed \"Type 901\" manual transmission was available. The styling was largely by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche. Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who initially objected, but later was also involved in the design.\nProduction of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market for a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the US. The Porsche 912, introduced in the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, 1,582\u00a0cc (1.6\u00a0L), 90\u00a0hp (67\u00a0kW; 91\u00a0PS) boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodywork with Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual transmission was optional).\nIn 1966, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S with Type 901/02 engine producing 160\u00a0PS (120\u00a0kW; 160\u00a0hp). Forged aluminum alloy wheels from Fuchs, with a 5-spoke design, were offered for the first time. In motor sport at the same time, the engine was developed into Type 901/20 installed in the mid-engined Porsche 904 and Porsche 906 with 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp), as well as fuel injected Type 901/21 installed in 906 and 910 with 220\u00a0PS (160\u00a0kW; 220\u00a0hp).\nIn August 1967, the A series went into production with dual brake circuits and widened (5.5J-15) wheels still fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 165HR15 CA67 tyres.,[10] and the previously standard gasoline-burning heater became optional. The Targa (meaning \"plate\" in Italian[11]) version was introduced. The Targa had a stainless steel-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open convertibles to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \"Targa\" came from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered from 1968).\nThe 110\u00a0PS (81\u00a0kW; 110\u00a0hp) 911T was also launched in 1967 with Type 901/03 engine. The 130\u00a0PS (96\u00a0kW; 130\u00a0hp) model was renamed the 911L with Type 901/06 engine and ventilated front disc brakes. The brakes had been introduced on the previous 911S. The 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited production (20 in all), as this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass reinforced plastic doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin overhead camshafts, and a power output of 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp).\nThe B series went into production in August 1968, replacing the 911L model with 911E with fuel injection. It remained in production until July 1969. The 911E gained 185/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36.[12] and 6J-15 wheels.\nThe C series was introduced in August 1969 with an enlarged 2.2-litre engine (84\u00a0mm bore x 66\u00a0mm stroke). The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from 2,211\u20132,268\u00a0mm (87.0\u201389.3\u00a0in), to help as a remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine). A semi-automatic Sportomatic[13] model, composed of a torque converter, an automatic clutch, and the four-speed transmission was added. It was canceled after the 1980 model year[14] partly because of the elimination of a forward gear to make it a three-speed.[14]\nThe D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971.\nThe 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine (155\u00a0PS (114\u00a0kW; 153\u00a0hp) at 6200\u00a0rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 (180\u00a0PS (130\u00a0kW; 180\u00a0hp) at 6500\u00a0rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to 160 kilometres per hour (99\u00a0mph).\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger 2,341\u00a0cc (2.3\u00a0L) engine. This is known as the \"2.4\u00a0L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres.\nThe 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was carbureted, except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130HP) to 140 HP, commonly known as a 911T/E.\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the Porsche 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door)\".\nThe F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from Bosch on Type 911/91 engine.\n911S models also gained a small spoiler under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. The cars weighed 1,050\u00a0kg (2,310\u00a0lb). The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either 3,987\u00a0cc (4.0\u00a0L) or 3,404\u00a0cc (3.4\u00a0L) displacement, producing 270\u00a0PS (200\u00a0kW; 270\u00a0hp) at 8000\u00a0rpm. Weight was down to 960\u00a0kg (2,120\u00a0lb). The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the Sebring 12 Hours, the 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring, and the Targa Florio.\nRS stands for Rennsport in German, meaning race sport. The Carrera name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was built to meet motorsport homologation requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2687\u00a0cc) developing 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp) with Bosch (Kugelfischer) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders. In RS Touring form it weighed 1,075\u00a0kg (2,370\u00a0lb), in Sport Lightweight form it was about 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb) lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 were made, and qualified for the FIA Group 4 class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with 2,808\u00a0cc (2.8\u00a0L) engines producing 300\u00a0PS (220\u00a0kW; 300\u00a0hp).\nFor the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \"whale tail\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres.\nIn 1974, Porsche created the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection producing 230\u00a0PS (170\u00a0kW; 230\u00a0hp). Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the Porsche 917 racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb).\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974 and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier Porsche 917, was Porsche's commitment to turbocharger applications in its cars.\nModel year 1974 (G Series. Aug. 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2687\u00a0cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact bumpers conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up\u2014 the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine producing 150\u00a0PS (110\u00a0kW; 150\u00a0hp) and 175\u00a0PS (129\u00a0kW; 173\u00a0hp), respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to 165\u00a0PS (121\u00a0kW; 163\u00a0hp) for Manufacturing Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10 HP between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at 175\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW; 177\u00a0PS).\nThe Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp) RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced 175\u00a0PS (129\u00a0kW; 173\u00a0hp). The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup\u00e9s weighed in at 1,075\u00a0kg (2,370\u00a0lb), the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring.\nFor the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \"ducktail\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T\u00dcV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced Porsche 930 Turbo.\nThe Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup\u00e9s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine.\nFor the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the Volkswagen 2.0 engine also used in the Porsche 914 for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine Porsche 924 for the 1977 model year.\nFor the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994\u00a0cc engine (minus the turbocharger). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed 200\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 200\u00a0hp) in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp). The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased.\nThe new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0\u201362\u00a0mph) in 6.1 seconds and 0\u2013200\u00a0km/h (0\u2013124\u00a0mph) in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately 236\u00a0km/h (147\u00a0mph).\nWeight increased marginally by 45\u00a0kg (99\u00a0lb) to 1,120\u00a0kg (2,470\u00a0lb).\nThe 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup\u00e9 (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatics.\nFor the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production turbocharged 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide tires, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"whale tail\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine 260\u00a0PS (190\u00a0kW; 260\u00a0hp) and four-speed manual transmission.\nProduction of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the Porsche 934 of 1976 participating at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and other races including battles with the BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\". The FIA Group 5 version called Porsche 935 evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \"slant nose\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed.\nFor the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre turbocharged engine with intercooler that produced 300\u00a0PS (220\u00a0kW; 300\u00a0hp). To fit the intercooler a newly designed \"tea-tray\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \"Carrera\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier version.\nIn 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the 964 turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then.\nIn 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \"SC\" stands for \"Super Carrera\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was 180\u00a0PS (130\u00a0kW; 180\u00a0bhp), later 188\u00a0bhp (140\u00a0kW; 191\u00a0PS) and then in 1981 it was increased to 204\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 201\u00a0bhp). The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The convertible body design also featured four-wheel drive, although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the 356 of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.[15] Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since.\nIn 1979, Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new 928 company flagship. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.[15]\nPeter W. Schutz (CEO Porsche AG 1981\u20131987) wrote: The decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr. Helmuth Bott de:Helmuth Bott, the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development. I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott's office. It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: 944, 928 and 911. Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing. The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.[16]\nThe replacement for the SC series came in 1984 as the 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies.\nA new higher-displacement motor, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.[17] The new swept volume of 3164 cc was achieved using the 95\u00a0mm (3.7\u00a0in) bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's 74.4\u00a0mm (2.9\u00a0in) stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from Getrag, model number G50 with proven BorgWarner synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\nWith the new engine, power was increased to 207\u00a0bhp (154\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0PS) (at 5900\u00a0rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to 231\u00a0bhp (172\u00a0kW; 234\u00a0PS) (at 5900\u00a0rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated 0\u201360\u00a0mph (0\u201397\u00a0km/h) in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) as measured by Autocar. Factory times were more modest: 0\u201360\u00a0mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control components to an L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to 217\u00a0bhp (162\u00a0kW; 220\u00a0PS) (at 5900\u00a0rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany.\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dash featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\". It was a style that resembled the Porsche 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer turbo suspension and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\nThe 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), 340 of which were produced from August 1987 to September 1989, is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera that, with engine and suspension modifications, was purpose built for club racing. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two unit), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \"Carrera\" logo, all in order to save an estimated 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb) in weight. With the exception of CSs delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \"CS Club Sport\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered.  Some U.S. CS's did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all CS's have a \"SP\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK CS's were all \"Grand Prix White\" with a red \"Carrera CS\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the stock 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.\nIn 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche\u2019s signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas),  250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries.\nFor 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup\u00e9s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic, and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \"silk grey\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \"25th Anniversary Special Edition\" badges\nAccording to the manufacturer, around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road today.[18]\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the Porsche 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171. The Speedster started as a design under Helmuth Bott in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.[19]\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).[20]\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the 959 flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing recession and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating four-wheel-drive, demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. Drag coefficient was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, ABS brakes and power steering made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3600\u00a0cc and developed 250\u00a0PS (184\u00a0kW). The rear-wheel-drive version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later.\nThe 964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3\u00a0L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6\u00a0L engine of the other 964 models was introduced.\nIn 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time Tiptronic automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual airbags standard (from 1991), the first being the Porsche 944 Turbo (from 1987).\nIn 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RSA's were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW) 3,746\u00a0cc (3.7\u00a0L) engine.\nSince the RS/RS America was intended as a no-frills, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a limited-slip differential, AM/FM cassette stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\nIn 1990 Porsche introduced a Turbocharged version of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a stillborn project that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3\u00a0L engine, improved to produce 320\u00a0PS (235\u00a0kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6\u00a0L engine, now in turbo-charged form and sending a staggering 360\u00a0PS (265\u00a0kW; 355\u00a0hp) to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare.\nThe 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the air-cooled 911 first introduced in 1964.  Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series.  As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"[21]  Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"[22] \"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"[23]\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the 959. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief Harm Lagaay and completed in 1991.\nAlong with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn Porsche 989's rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.\nThe new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6\u00a0L, but power rose to 272\u00a0PS (200\u00a0kW / 268\u00a0BHP) thanks to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286\u00a0PS (210\u00a0kW / 281\u00a0BHP). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \"Varioram\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12\u00a0hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the rear-wheel-drive versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS 993 had a 3.8\u00a0L engine with 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW / 296\u00a0BHP), and was only rear-wheel drive.\nNon-turbo models appeared that used the Turbo's wide bodyshell and some other components (the Carrera 4S and later the Carrera S) but not the large tack-on Turbo \"hibachi\" spoiler.  \"The Carrera S series (C2S) from 1997 thru 1998 is (according to most Porsche enthusiasts) the most highly sought after version of the 993.\"[24]\nThe Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window. The expensive air-cooled 993 Targa had a limited release between 1996 and 1998.  [Production numbers:[25] 1996: US/Can: 462 ROW: 1980, 1997: US/Can: 567 ROW: 1276, 1998: US/Can: 122 (100 Tiptronic / 22 Manual)]\nAs an investment, the 1997 and 1998 C2S version has proven the most desirable (apart from even rarer models such as the RS and Turbo S). \"Many find that they are the best looking 911 there is and used prices have always seemed to reflect this. They command a hefty premium in today's market and the very best example wide body cars can be priced more than the higher mileage Turbos.\"[26]  Of the widebody 993 series, \"The purists will want 2 wheel drive and nothing else will do.\"[27]  Similarly, purists will insist upon the manual transmission over the automatic \"Tiptronic\" version; this is even more true in the case of the 993 as compared with other models, because Porsche 993s were the first production model (apart from the 959 supercar) to feature a 6-speed manual transmission.[28]  The C2S wide-body 993s are in scarce supply, with none built in 1995 or 1996, and just 759 units made for North America in 1997, with a final supply of 993 in 1998, for a total of 1,752 C2S examples overall.[29]\nA Turbocharged version of the 993 was launched in 1995 and became the first standard production Porsche with twin turbochargers and the first 911 Turbo to be equipped with permanent all-wheel-drive (the homologated GT2 version based on the Turbo retained RWD). The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the Porsche 959.[30] The 3.6\u00a0L twin turbo M64/60 engine produced 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW / 402\u00a0BHP). The performance was outstanding, as 0 to 60\u00a0mph has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive 60 to 0 in 2.3 seconds. The car's top speed was measured at 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h) at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. There were basically two years of production 1996 model year and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.\nIn 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24\u00a0PS (17.7\u00a0kW) over the regular Turbo's 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added.\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a water-cooled flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34\u00a0years, and the body shell received its first major re-design.\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engined Boxster. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003.[31]\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 coefficient of drag. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s.[32]\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look') models, the club racing-oriented GT3 and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the forced-induction 996 Turbo and GT2. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and twin-turbocharged, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale.\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for model year 2002, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained.\nEngine displacement was 3.4\u00a0L and power was 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW; 296\u00a0hp) featuring a change to an \"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6\u00a0L and power received an increase to 320\u00a0PS (235\u00a0kW).\nThe folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch.\nStarting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear limited-slip differential, except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.[citation needed]\nPorsche released a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996s, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the Porsche 911 GT1 '98 sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm.\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated 3,600\u00a0cc (3.6\u00a0L) flat-six (F6) rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It produced 360\u00a0bhp (268\u00a0kW; 365\u00a0PS) at first and later improved to 381\u00a0bhp (284\u00a0kW; 386\u00a0PS) at the end of the 996 series' revision.\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the Turbocharged version of the Type 996 for MY 2001. Like the GT3, the new Turbo engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now developed 420\u00a0PS (309\u00a0kW; 414\u00a0hp).[33] Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that boosted the engine output to 450\u00a0PS (331\u00a0kW; 444\u00a0hp) with 620\u00a0N\u00b7m (457\u00a0lb\u00b7ftf) of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0\u201362\u00a0mph) in 3.91\u00a0seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power\u2014 450\u00a0PS (331\u00a0kW) and 620\u00a0N\u00b7m (457\u00a0lb\u00b7ftf)\u2014 than the regular Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of 189\u00a0mph (304\u00a0km/h).[33]\nThe styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the Porsche 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper.\nThe 996-series was replaced with the 997 in 2005. It keeps the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design, drifting from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it.\nInitially, two versions of the 997 were introduced\u2014 the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera produced 325\u00a0PS (239\u00a0kW) from its 3.6\u00a0L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8\u00a0L 355\u00a0PS (261\u00a0kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S.  Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19\u00a0inch (48\u00a0cm) \"Lobster Fork\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and sports steering wheel.\nIn late 2005, Porsche announced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76\u00a0inches (32\u00a0mm)  to cover wider rear tires. The 0\u201362\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) for the Carrera 4S with the 261\u00a0kW (355\u00a0PS; 350\u00a0hp) engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8\u00a0seconds.[34] The 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the 355\u00a0PS (261\u00a0kW; 350\u00a0hp) was noted to be as fast as 4.2\u00a0seconds in a recent Motor Trend comparison, and Road & Track has timed it at 3.8\u00a0seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively. The Targas (4 and 4S), released in November 2006, are 4-wheel-drive versions that divide the difference between the coup\u00e9s and the cabriolets with their dual, sliding glass tops.\nThe 2009 model year 997 received a larger air intake in the front bumper, new headlights, new rear taillights, new clean-sheet design direct fuel injection engines, and the introduction of a dual-clutch gearbox called PDK.[35][36] They were also equipped with Bluetooth support.\nThe change to the 7th generation (991)  took place in the middle of the model year 2012. A 2012 Porsche 911 can either be a 997 or a 991, depending on the month of the production.\nThe Turbocharged version of the 997 series featured the same 3.6\u00a0L twin-turbocharged engine as the 996 Turbo, with modifications to produce 480\u00a0PS (353\u00a0kW; 473\u00a0bhp) and 620\u00a0N\u22c5m (457\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque. It has VTG (variable turbine geometry), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo.\nThe 997 Turbo features a new all-wheel-drive system, similar to the one found on the Porsche Cayenne. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009,[37] the PTM system has now been tweaked to give a more rearward power bias. The new 911 Turbo introduces paddle shifters for the PDK double-clutch gearbox.[37] The new 911 turbo uses a different engine. The previous water-cooled turbos (996 and 997) measured 3600cc. This new engine measures 3800cc (3.8 liters) and was first developed for the Carrera that was launched in 2008. The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system have been uprated. It develops  493\u00a0PS (363\u00a0kW; 486\u00a0bhp) which is 20\u00a0bhp more than the previous model.[37] The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.[37] Porsche claims the new 911 turbo will go from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (0 to 62\u00a0mph) in 3.4 seconds, or 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 3.2 seconds and can attain a top-speed of 312\u00a0km/h (194\u00a0mph).\nAs with the 996 Turbo the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carreras including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit.\nA new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard. It also comes with re engineered turbos to give an extra 30 horsepower to a total of 523\u00a0PS (385\u00a0kW; 516\u00a0bhp).\nThe 911 GT3 was added to the 997 lineage on 23 February 2006. Performance figures include a  0\u2013100 kilometres per hour (0\u201362\u00a0mph) acceleration time of 4.1\u00a0seconds and a top speed of 310\u00a0km/h (193\u00a0mph), almost as fast as the Turbo. Porsche's factory reports were proven to be conservative about the performance of the car; Excellence magazine tested the 997 GT3 and recorded a 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h of 3.9\u00a0seconds and a top speed of 312\u00a0km/h (194\u00a0mph). It was at that time crowned \"the best handling car in America\" by Motor Trend.\nThe 911 GT3 RS was announced in early 2006 as a homologation version of the GT3 RSR racing car for competition events like Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nThe drivetrain of the RS is based on the 911 GT3, except for the addition of a lightweight flywheel and closer gear ratios for further improved response under acceleration.  Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track.\nVisually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme \u2013 bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973.  The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing.  The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator.\nThe European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage.\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009. An estimated 413 units were delivered to the US and the worldwide production run is estimated to be under 2,000 vehicles.[38]\nIn August 2009, Porsche announced the second generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 3.8-litre engine producing 450\u00a0bhp (336\u00a0kW), a modified suspension, dynamic engine mounts, new titanium sport exhaust, and modified lightweight bodywork.[39]\nIn April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine producing 500\u00a0bhp (373\u00a0kW), Porsche designed the GT3 RS 4.0 using lightweight components such as bucket seats, carbon-fibre bonnet and front wings, and plastic rear windows for weight reduction, while using suspension components from the racing version. Other characteristics include low centre of gravity, large rear wing and an aerodynamically optimised body. The lateral front air deflection vanes, a first on a production Porsche, increase downforce on the front axle. Aided by a steeply inclined rear wing, aerodynamic forces exert an additional 190\u00a0kg, enhancing the 911 GT3 RS 4.0's grip to the tarmac. The GT3 RS 4.0 weighs 2,998\u00a0lb.[40]\nThe Type 996 911 GT2 was superseded by the Type 997 GT2 in 2007. The new car was announced on 16 July of that year, but was launched during the 62nd Frankfurt Motor Show, held every other year in Frankfurt, Germany. It arrived in dealerships from November 2007.[41]\nThe 997 GT2 has a twin-turbocharged 3.6-litre flat-6 engine, which generates 523\u00a0hp (390\u00a0kW)[42] at 6500 rpm, and 505\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (685\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque from 2200 to 4500 rpm. It has a 6-speed manual transmission and is rear wheel drive. With a curb weight of 3,175\u00a0lb (1,440\u00a0kg), the Porsche 997 GT2 accelerates from 0\u201360\u00a0mph (0\u201397\u00a0km/h) in 3.6\u00a0seconds, and from 0 to 100\u00a0mph (161\u00a0km/h) in 7.4\u00a0seconds, and has a top speed of 204\u00a0mph (328\u00a0km/h). This makes it the first street-legal 911 to exceed 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h), with the exception of the 1998 911 GT1 road car (which is broadly considered not to be a true 911 due to its mid-mounted engine).\nMotor Trend tested a 2008 Porsche 911 GT2 and found the 0\u201360\u00a0mph acceleration time at 3.4\u00a0seconds, and 11.4\u00a0seconds at 127.9 miles per hour (205.8\u00a0km/h) for the quarter mile. The GT2 also recorded a braking distance from 60 to 0 miles per hour (97 to 0\u00a0km/h) of 98 feet (30\u00a0m) and recorded 1.10g lateral grip.[43] The GT2 made an appearance on Top Gear, where it had a lap time of 1:19.5, faster than a Carrera GT by .3 of a second.\nIts appearance differs slightly from its sister-car, the 911 (997) Turbo, in a few ways. It does not have fog lights in the front bumper, it has a revised front lip, it has a different rear wing (with two small air scoops on either side), and it has a different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes).\nThe 997 GT2 is also different from the 997 Turbo in that it is rear-wheel-drive rather than all-wheel-drive.[44]\nOn 4 May 2010, an RS variant was announced to German dealers in Leipzig. The GT2 RS develops 620\u00a0PS (456\u00a0kW; 612\u00a0hp) and 700\u00a0N\u22c5m (516\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque and weighs 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb) less than the standard GT2, allowing for a top speed of 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) and the 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0-62\u00a0mph) acceleration time of 3.4 seconds.[45]\nUnveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show,[46] the Sport Classic is a limited (250 units- all sold in under 48 hours) version of 911 Carrera S coup\u00e9, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7. The engine is rated at 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW; 402\u00a0hp) via newly developed resonance intake manifold with 6 vacuum-controlled switching flaps. It includes 6-speed manual transmission, double-dome roof, 44\u00a0mm (1.7\u00a0in) wider rear fenders, SportDesign front apron with a spoiler lip and a fixed 'duck tail' rear wing (similar to the one found on the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7), PCCB Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, 20\u00a0mm (0.8\u00a0in) lower PASM sports suspension, mechanical rear axle differential, 19-inch black fuchs wheels, Porsche Exclusive woven leather seats and door panels, dashboard with Espresso Nature natural leather upholstery, and a specially developed Sport Classic Grey body colour.\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling the iconic car of the 1950s. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the 930 and 964 generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS, and produced 408\u00a0hp (304\u00a0kW; 414\u00a0PS). It accelerated from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h). Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \"loyal customers\".)\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\nThe 991 introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since the original 911. Porsche revealed basic information on the new Carrera and Carrera S models on 23 August 2011.[47] The Carrera is powered by a 350\u00a0hp (257\u00a0kW) 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine producing 400\u00a0hp (294\u00a0kW). A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power to 430\u00a0hp. The new 991's overall length grows by 2.2\u00a0inches and wheelbase grows by 3.9\u00a0inches (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly 3 inches towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track (2.0\u00a0inches wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer.\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. Front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the Carrera GT and adopted by the Panamera.\nThe 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly aluminium construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to 50 kilograms (110\u00a0lb) lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0\u201360\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph in as little as 4.2 seconds[48] and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds.[49]\nApart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission with rev-matching. A new feature with the manual transmission is that it blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear.\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system. The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models.\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology.\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tires, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911.\nIn May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to 520\u00a0hp on the 'Turbo', and 560\u00a0hp on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0-60\u00a0mph acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A rear-wheel steering system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that will steer the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling.[50] During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models. These new models come equipped with an all-new roof technology with the original Targa design, now with an all-electric cabriolet roof along with the B-pillar and the glass 'dome' at the rear.\nIn September 2015, Porsche revealed the second generation of 991 Carrera models at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Both Carrera and Carrera S models break with previous tradition by featuring a 3.0 turbo-charged 6-cylinder boxer engine, marking the first time that a forced induction engine has been fitted to the base models within the 911 range.[51]\nIn 2016, Porsche unveiled a limited production 911 R based on the GT3 RS. Production was limited to 991 units worldwide.[52] It has an overall weight of 1,370\u00a0kg (3,020\u00a0lb), a high-revving 4.0 L six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine from the 991 GT3 RS, and a six-speed manual transmission, while an air conditioning and audio systems are removable options to save weight.[53] The car goes from 0\u201397\u00a0km/h (0\u201360\u00a0mph) in 3.7 seconds and has a top speed of 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph).[52]\nPorsche introduced the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013.[54] The 991 GT3 features a new 3.8 litre direct fuel injection (DFI) flat-six engine developing 475\u00a0hp (354\u00a0kW; 482\u00a0PS) at 8,250 rpm, a Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) double-clutch gearbox and rear-wheel steering. The engine is based on the unit fitted in the 991 Carrera S, but shares only a few common parts. All other components, particularly the crankshaft and valve train, were specially adapted or developed for the 991 GT3.[55] The dual-clutch gearbox is another feature specially developed for the 991 GT3, based on sequential manual transmissions used in racing cars.[56] The 911 GT3 is claimed to be able to accelerate from 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.1 seconds or less, and the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds at 126\u00a0mph (203\u00a0km/h).[57][58] The GT3 has a claimed top speed of 202\u00a0mph (325\u00a0km/h).[59]\nPorsche unveiled the facelifted 991.2 GT3 at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a  manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission. A touring version was also introduced which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual transmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear wing instead.\nPorsche launched the Renn Sport version of the 911 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[60] Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the 911 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that develops 500\u00a0hp (507\u00a0PS; 373\u00a0kW) and 339 pound-feet (460\u00a0N\u00b7m) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The car accelerates from 0-62\u00a0mph (0\u2013100\u00a0km/h) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0-124\u00a0mph (0\u2013200\u00a0km/h) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013- and Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, there is rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock.\nIn February 2018, Porsche revealed a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and 20\u00a0PS (15\u00a0kW; 20\u00a0bhp) and 10\u00a0N\u22c5m (7.4\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) increase over the previous GT3 RS, NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2 GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the GT2 RS) for increased downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs, lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed tyre compound. A Weissach package including additional carbon fibre body and interior parts as well as magnesium wheels and stiffer suspension settings is available as an option.[61]\nThe high performance GT2 version made a return to the 991 lineage but now as an RS variant only with no standard variant being produced unlike the previous generations. It was initially unveiled at the 2017 E3 along with the announcement of the Forza Motorsport 7 video game.\nThe car was officially launched by Porsche at the 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed along with the introduction of the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. The 991 GT2 RS is powered by a 3.8\u00a0L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine that produces a maximum power of 700\u00a0PS (515\u00a0kW; 690\u00a0hp) at 7,000 rpm and 750\u00a0N\u22c5m (550\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque, making it the most powerful 911 ever built. Unlike the previous GT2 versions, this car is fitted with a 7-speed PDK transmission to handle the excessive torque produced from the engine. Porsche claims that this car will accelerate from 0 to 60\u00a0mph in 2.7\u00a0seconds, and has a top speed of 340\u00a0km/h (210\u00a0mph).\nThe car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, front and rear spoilers and boot lid made of carbon, front and rear apron made of lightweight polyurethane, rear and side windows made of polycarbonate and features a titanium exhaust system. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of 1,470\u00a0kg (3,241\u00a0lb).\nA Weissach package option is available, which reduces 30\u00a0kg (66\u00a0lb) of weight, courtesy to the additional use of carbon-fiber and titanium parts. This includes the roof, the anti-roll bars and the coupling rods on both axles made out of carbon-fiber while the package also includes a set of light-weight magnesium wheels.[62]\nThe Porsche 911 GT1 is a car that was developed in 1996 for the GT1 class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In order to qualify for GT racing, 25 road-going models were built to achieve type homologation. The car developed around 600\u00a0hp (447\u00a0kW; 608\u00a0PS) (537\u00a0hp (400\u00a0kW; 544\u00a0PS) for the street version) and accelerated from 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 3.3 seconds. The top speed was 205\u00a0mph (330\u00a0km/h). Both the road and race cars carried the same twin turbocharged engine as used in the 962, and the race car was a match for the then dominant McLaren F1 GTRs. A redeveloped version of the 911 GT1 race car was later built, winning outright at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car is not considered to be a real 911[citation needed], as it is derived from the 962 with the 996 911's front section. It was the most powerful and fastest road-going Porsche until the introduction of the Carrera GT in 2004 and later the 918 Spyder in 2013.\nIn 1999, the 911 placed fifth in the  Global Automotive Elections Foundation's Car of the Century competition, trailing mass market cars: Ford Model T, BMC Mini, Citro\u00ebn DS, and Volkswagen Beetle.[63][64]\nIn 2004, Sports Car International named the 911 number three on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, the Carrera RS number seven on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s, and the 911 Carrera number seven on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s. In addition, the 911 was voted Number 2 on Automobile Magazine's list of the \"100 Coolest Cars\". Motor Trend chose the Porsche 911 Carrera S as its Best Driver's Car for 2012.[65] It also won \"World Performance Car Of The Year\" in 2014.[66]\nIn 2015, Car and Driver named the Porsche 911 \"the best premium sports car on the market\".[67]\n", "Porsche 911 (classic)": "all variants air-cooled flat-6 (H6)\n2.0 L 110\u2013170\u00a0PS (81\u2013125\u00a0kW)\n2.2 L 125\u2013180\u00a0PS (92\u2013132\u00a0kW)\n2.4 L 130\u2013190\u00a0PS (96\u2013140\u00a0kW)\n2.7 L 150\u2013210\u00a0PS (110\u2013150\u00a0kW)\n3.0 L 180\u2013204\u00a0PS (132\u2013150\u00a0kW)\n3.2 L 207\u00a0PS (152\u00a0kW)\u2013231\u00a0PS (170\u00a0kW)\n3.0 L Turbo 260\u00a0PS (190\u00a0kW)\nThe original Porsche 911 (pronounced nine eleven, German: Neunelfer) was a luxury sports car made by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. The famous, distinctive, and durable design was introduced in autumn 1963[2] and built through 1989. It was succeeded by a modified version, internally referred to as Porsche 964 but still sold as Porsche 911, as are current models.\nMechanically, the 911 was notable for being rear engined and air-cooled. From its inception, the 911 was modified both by private teams and the factory itself for racing, rallying and other types of automotive competition. The original 911 series is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, especially when its variations are included, mainly the powerful 911-derived 935 which won 24 Hours of Le Mans and other major sports cars races outright against prototypes.\nThe Porsche 911 was developed as a much more powerful, larger, more comfortable replacement for the Porsche 356. The new car made its public debut at the 1963[2] Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, better known to English speakers as the Frankfurt Motor Show.\nIt was initially designated as the \"Porsche 901\", after its internal project number. However, Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. So, instead of selling the new model with another name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. It went on sale in 1964.\nThe earliest editions of the 911 had an air-cooled, rear-mounted, 2.0L (1991\u00a0cc) \n130\u00a0PS (96\u00a0kW) flat-6 \"boxer\"  engine, similar to the 356's four-cylinder 1.6L unit. It was mated to a five-speed manual \"Type 901\" transmission. The car had 2+2 seating, though the rear were very small, also like the 356.  The styling was largely by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche. Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department, was also involved in the design.\nWhen 356 production came to an end in 1965 there was still a market for a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the USA. The Porsche 912, a slightly downscaled 911 fitted with the 356's 90\u00a0hp (67\u00a0kW) engine, was introduced the same year as its replacement.\nIn 1967, Porsche introduced the more powerful 160\u00a0PS (120\u00a0kW; 160\u00a0hp) 911S. Alloy wheels from Fuchs, in a distinctive 5-leaf design, were offered for the first time. A 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp) racing version of the 911 engine was developed and used in the mid-engined Porsche 904 and Porsche 906 track cars.\nThe Targa version, with a stainless steel-clad roll bar, appeared the same year. Porsche had feared the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would outlaw fully open convertibles[citation needed], an important market for the 356.  It was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered alongside from 1968).\nThe name \"Targa\" - shield in Italian - came from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, in which Porsche had scored seven victories since 1956, with four more to come through 1973. This last in the subsequently discontinued event is especially notable as it was won with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by Italian factories of Ferrari and Alfa Romeo.\nThe 110\u00a0PS (81\u00a0kW; 110\u00a0hp) 911T was also launched in 1967 and effectively replaced the 912. The staple 130\u00a0PS (96\u00a0kW; 130\u00a0hp) model was renamed the 911L. The 911R, a lightweight racing version with thin aluminium doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin-spark cylinder heads, and a power output of 210\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0hp), had a very limited production of just 20 cars.\nIn 1969, the slightly lengthened B series was introduced.  It moved the rear wheels on all 911 and 912 models 57\u00a0mm aft, increasing wheelbase from 2,211 to 2,268 millimetres (87.0 to 89.3\u00a0in) to remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit.  Fuel injection arrived both for the 911S and a new middle model, the 911E.  A semi-automatic Sportomatic model, composed of a torque converter, automatic clutch, and four-speed transmission, was added to the product lineup.[3]\nA concept designed by Pininfarina, lengthening the wheelbase by 7.5\u00a0in (190\u00a0mm) and resulting in a car that weighed almost 2,500\u00a0lb (1,100\u00a0kg).[4]\nFor MY 1970 the engines of all 911s were increased to 2,195\u00a0cc (2.195\u00a0L; 133.9\u00a0cu\u00a0in). Power outputs were uprated to 125\u00a0PS (92\u00a0kW; 123\u00a0hp) in the 911T, 155\u00a0PS (114\u00a0kW; 153\u00a0hp) in the 911E, and 180\u00a0PS (130\u00a0kW; 180\u00a0hp) in the 911S. The 912 was discontinued with the 914 taking its place as an entry model.\nDespite the lower power output of the 911E compared to the 911S, the 911E was quicker in acceleration up to 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph).[citation needed]\nIt was a prototype extended by 13.6\u00a0in (345\u00a0mm) over stock car, with 911S engine.[4]\nThe 1972\u20131973 model years consisted of the same models of 911\u2014 the entry level T, the midrange E and the top of the line S. However, all models got a new, larger 2,341\u00a0cc (2.341\u00a0L; 142.9\u00a0cu\u00a0in) engine. This is universally known as the \"2.4L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres\u2014 perhaps to emphasize the increase over the 2.2\u00a0L. The new power ratings for the T were 130\u00a0hp (97\u00a0kW), or 140\u00a0hp (104\u00a0kW) in the U.S., 165\u00a0hp (123\u00a0kW) for the E and 190\u00a0hp (142\u00a0kW) for the S.\nThe 911E and 911S used mechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. The 911T was carbureted, except in the US where it also used MFI, which accounts for the 7\u00a0kW (9\u00a0hp) power difference between the two. In January, 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from Bosch.  These CIS-powered cars are usually referred to as \"1973.5\" models by enthusiasts.\nWith the power and torque increases, the 2.4\u00a0L cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the Porsche 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901/911 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc.  Some say this was because the dog-leg shift to second gear was inconvenient for city driving, other say it was due to Porsche\u2019s desire to put 5th gear outside the main transmission housing where it could easily be changed for different races. The Sportomatic transmission was still available but only as a special order.\nIn 1972 a tremendous effort was made to improve the handling of the 911. Due to the 911's unusual engine placement (rear-mounted, with most of the vehicle's weight concentrated over the rear axle) early 911's were prone to oversteer when driven at the limit, and could easily spin in the hands of an inexperienced driver. In an attempt to remedy this, Porsche relocated the oil tank from its position behind the right rear wheel to in front of it. This had the effect of moving the weight of almost 8.5\u00a0l (9 US quarts) of oil from outside the wheelbase to inside, improving weight distribution and thus, handling. To facilitate filling of the oil tank, Porsche installed an oil filler door (much like the fuel filler door on the left front fender) on the right rear quarter panel. Unfortunately, this unique design was scrapped after only one year, some say because inattentive gas station attendants were putting gas in the oil tank. The oil tank was subsequently moved back to its original position for model year 1973, and remained there until it was moved back within the wheelbase for the 964 models.\n911S models also gained a discreet spoiler under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. With the car's weight only 1050\u00a0kg (2315\u00a0lb), these are often regarded as the best classic mainstream 911s. For racing at this time, the 911 ST was produced in limited numbers (the production run for the ST only lasted from 1970 to 1971.) The cars were available with engines of either 2466\u00a0cc or 2492\u00a0cc, producing 270\u00a0PS (199\u00a0kW) at 8000\u00a0rpm. Weight was down to 960\u00a0kg (2166\u00a0lb). The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the Sebring 12 Hours, the 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring and the Targa Florio.\nThese models, valued by collectors, are considered by many to be the greatest classic 911s of all-time. RS stands for Rennsport in German, meaning \"racing sport\". The Carrera name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was built so that Porsche could enter racing formulae that demanded that a certain minimum number of production cars were made. Compared with a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine 2,687\u00a0cc (2.7\u00a0L; 164.0\u00a0cu\u00a0in) with a bore x stroke of 90\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a070.4\u00a0mm (3.54\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a02.77\u00a0in) developing 210\u00a0PS (207\u00a0hp; 154\u00a0kW) @ 6300 rpm and 255\u00a0N\u22c5m (188\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 5100 rpm of torque with Bosch Mechanical Fuel Injection [5], revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear wings. In RS Touring form it weighed 1075\u00a0kg (2370\u00a0lb), in Sport Lightweight form it was about 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb) lighter, the saving coming from the thin-gauge steel used for parts of the bodyshell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1580 were made, comfortably exceeding the 500 that had to be made to qualify for the vital FIA Group 4 class. 49 Carrera RSR cars were built with 2808\u00a0cc engines producing 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW).\nIn 1974, Porsche created the Carrera RS 3.0 with K-Jetronic Bosch fuel injection producing 230\u00a0PS (169\u00a0kW).It was almost twice as expensive as the 2.7 RS but offered a fair amount of racing capability for that price. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the brake system was from the Porsche 917. The use of thin metal plate panels and a spartan interior enabled the shipping weight to be reduced to around 900\u00a0kg (1984\u00a0lb).\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 and Carrera RSR Turbo (its 2.1\u00a0L engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) were made in tiny numbers for racing. The turbo car came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sportscar racing, and can be regarded as the start of its commitment to turbocharging.\n\nMY 1974 was the introduction of impact bumpers to conform with low speed protection requirements of US law, these bumpers being so successfully integrated into the design that they remained unchanged for 15 years.  In 1974 the engine size was increased to 2687\u00a0cc giving an increase in torque.  The use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up\u2014 the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear wings of the old 2.4, now had a detuned version of the RS engine producing 150 and 175\u00a0bhp (110 and 129\u00a0kW) respectively.\nThe Carrera 2.7 was mechanically identical to the 1973 RS, inheriting its 210\u00a0bhp (154\u00a0kW) MFI engine and still weighed the same at 1075\u00a0kg (2370\u00a0lb).\nIt had the wide RS rear wings and also the ducktail for the 1974 model (except for the German market).\nIt was available either as a coupe or a Targa.\nFor 1976 a special run of 113 coupes with MFI were made. In addition 30 MFI Targas with narrow rear wings were made for the Belgian police.\nThe US Carrera 2.7 was restricted to the 2.7 K-Jetronic engine as the MFI RS engine was banned on emission grounds. Power output was 175\u00a0bhp, later being reduced to 165\u00a0bhp, and in California 160\u00a0bhp.\nThe well known problem of pulled cylinder head studs with the K-Jetronic 2.7 engine only occurred in hot climates. This emerged in 1975 in California where thermal reactors, aimed at reducing emissions, were fitted below the cylinder heads thus causing heat build up around the magnesium crankcase and then made worse by the lean running K-Jetronic CIS. The fitting of a 5-blade engine fan instead of the usual 11-blade further compounded the situation.\nBearing in mind Porsche's largest market being the USA, the 930 Turbo, Carrera 3.0 and all subsequent models used aluminium alloy crankcases which were around 15\u00a0lb (7\u00a0kg) heavier.\nThe Bosch K-Jetronic CIS varied fuel pressure to the injectors dependent on the mass airflow.  While this system was exceedingly reliable, it did not allow the use of as \"hot\" cams as MFI or carburettors allowed.  Therefore, the 911S's horsepower decreased from 190 to 175\u00a0PS (140\u2013128\u00a0kW) despite the displacement increase from 2.4 to 2.7\u00a0L. However, the engine did have increased drivability.\nAlso produced for the 1976 \"model year\", for the U.S. market, was the 912E, a 4-cylinder version of the 911 like the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis and the 2.0  Volkswagen engine from the Porsche 914. In all, 2099 units were produced.  In 1976 the Porsche 924 took this car's place for the 1977 \"model year\" and beyond. The power was supplied by a 4-cylinder high-performance fuel injection motor also used in the 411 Volkswagen. Less than 6000 were built.\nThe Carrera 3.0 was given the same diecast aluminium crankcase as the 930 or \u2019911 Turbo\u2019.\nIts 3-litre engine had K-Jetronic CIS fuel injection. Power output was slightly down on the Carrera 2.7 at 200\u00a0bhp although the 188\u00a0lb/ft of torque was now available at 4200 rpm. \nWeight was up by 45\u00a0kg to 1120\u00a0kg.\nDuring its two-year life span, only 3687 cars were built.  Of these 2564 were coup\u00e9s and 1123 Targas.\nIn 1974 Porsche introduced the first production turbocharged 911. Although called simply Porsche 911 Turbo in Europe, it was marketed as Porsche 930 (930 being its internal type number) in North America. The body shape is distinctive, thanks to wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide tires, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"whale tail\" on the early cars, and \"tea-tray\" on the later ones. Starting out with a 3.0\u00a0L engine 260\u00a0PS (190\u00a0kW; 260\u00a0hp), it rose to 3.3\u00a0L 300\u00a0PS (220\u00a0kW; 300\u00a0hp) for 1978. The early cars are known for their exhilarating acceleration coupled with challenging handling characteristics and extreme turbo lag.\nProduction figures of the car soon qualified its racing version for FIA Group 4 competition as the Porsche 934 of 1976. Many participated at Le Mans and other races including some epic battles with the BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\". The wilder Porsche 935, a finer tuned car in FIA Group 5 and evolved from the 2.1\u00a0L RSR Turbo of 1974, was campaigned in 1976 by the factory and won Le Mans in 1979. Private teams continued to compete successfully with the car until well into the 1980s.\nDue to ever more draconian emissions regulations, the 930 was withheld from the important US and Japanese markets from 1981 through 1985.  In the same time period, Porsche was involved in several wrongful death lawsuits in California related to the 930, even involving privately imported European market 930's. It was finally re-introduced into the United States in 1986.\nAs demand for the Turbo soared in the late 1980s, Porsche introduced novelty variants including a slant-nose version (option M505/M506), while not significantly improving the range mechanically. Although these cars could be sold for extraordinary premiums over the standard models, the company's reluctance to invest in research and development of the entire 911 line at that time turned out to be an almost fatal decision not only for the 911, but for the company.\nOnly in 1989, its last year of production, was the 930 equipped with a five-speed gearbox. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with a 964 version featuring the same 3.3 L engine.\nThere have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911.\nStarting in MY 1978, the new 3.0\u00a0L 911 SC (2994\u00a0cc) was now the basic 911 model. It was in effect a Carrera 3 (known as a 911S in the US) detuned to provide 180\u00a0PS (132\u00a0kW). The \"SC\" designation was reintroduced by Porsche for the first time since the 356 SC (as distinguished from the race-engined 356 Carrera). No Carrera versions were produced and the 930 Turbo remaining at the top of the range.  Porsche\u2019s engineers felt that the weight of the extra luxury, safety and emissions equipment on these cars was blunting performance compared to the earlier, lighter cars with the same power output, so in non-US cars, power was increased to 188\u00a0PS (138\u00a0kW) for 1980, then finally to 204\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW). However, cars sold in the US market retained their lower-compression 180 PS engines throughout. This enabled them to be run on lower-octane fuel.\nIn model year 1980, Porsche offered a Weissach special edition version of the 911 SC, named after the town in Germany where Porsche has their research center.  Designated M439, it was offered in two colors with the turbo whale tail & front chin spoiler, body color-matched Fuchs\u00a0(de) alloy wheels and other convenience features as standard.  408 cars were built for North America.[6]  In 1982, a Ferry Porsche Edition was made and a total of 200 cars were sold with this cosmetic package.\nSCs sold in the UK could be specified with the Sport Group Package (UK) which added stiffer suspension, the rear spoiler, front rubber lip and black Fuchs wheels\u00a0(de).\nIn 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Not only was the car a true convertible, but it also featured four-wheel drive, although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model.  This was Porsche\u2019s first cabriolet since the 356 of the mid-1960s. It proved very popular with 4,214 sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.[7]  Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since.\nIt was during this time, that Porsche AG decided the long-term fate of the 911.  In 1979 Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new 928.  Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions.\nPeter W. Schutz (CEO Porsche AG 1981-1987) wrote:\n\u201cThe decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr Helmuth Bott de:Helmuth Bott, the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development.  I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott\u2019s office.  It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: 944, 928 and 911.  Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981.  I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart.  I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing.  The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.\u201d[8]\n911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.[7]\nWith the 911\u2019s future assured, 1983 saw the launch of a replacement for the successful SC series.  It was the MY 1984 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. The 911 3.2 Carrera was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling with new brake, electronic and suspension technologies.\nA new, higher-displacement motor, a 3.2-liter horizontally opposed flat 6 cylinder, was utilized. At the time, Porsche claimed it was 80% new.[9]  The new swept volume of 3164 cc was achieved using the 95\u00a0mm (3.7\u00a0in) bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's 74.4\u00a0mm (2.9\u00a0in) stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (although only 9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted.  The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years.  In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from Getrag, model number G50 with proven Borg-Warner synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\nWith the new engine, power was increased to 207\u00a0bhp (154\u00a0kW; 210\u00a0PS) at 5900 rpm for North American-delivered cars and to 231\u00a0bhp (172\u00a0kW; 234\u00a0PS) at 5900 rpm for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated 0\u2013 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 5.4 seconds (Car & Driver tested 5.3 seconds for the US version[10]) and had a top speed of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) as measured by Autocar. Factory times were more modest: 0-60\u00a0mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version  and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\nThe disc brakes were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine.  To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well.  This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control components to a L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun.  Changes in the fuel map & chip programming from October 1986, further improved the power to 217\u00a0bhp (162\u00a0kW; 220\u00a0PS)  at 5900 rpm for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets requesting low emissions, like Germany.  Custom-mapped chips remain a popular upgrade.  The fuel relay that is mounted externally on the DME is known to be a weak point of the system.\nThree basic models were available throughout the Carrera years \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. When launched in 1984 in the United States, the prices of the 911 Carrera lineup were $31,950 for the coup\u00e9, $33,450 for the targa and $36,450 for the cabriolet.[11]  Almost indistinguishable from the SC, external clues are the front fog lights, which were integrated into the front valance in the Carrera.  Very modest cosmetic changes were made throughout the lifespan of the Carrera, with a redesigned dash featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\nTwo special editions of the Carrera were produced \u2013 the \"Commemorative Edition\" in 1988 to commemorate 250,000 911s produced and an \"Anniversary\" edition in 1989 which was the model\u2019s 25th year of production.  Both were cosmetic packages with limited production.\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\". It was a style that resembled the Porsche 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\u201d tail.  It featured the stiffer turbo suspension and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels.  Sales of the Supersport were particularly strong for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the Porsche 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2104) between January 1989 and July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look, which also featured 930 brakes, wheels, suspension, and front valence.\n171 narrow body examples were built, and 823 examples were built for the US market. It started as a design under Helmuth Bott  in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.[12]\nThe 1987 Carrera Club Sport, of which 340 were produced, is a collectible 911 that had a blueprinted engine with a higher rev limit, and had the electric windows, electric seats, and radio removed to save a claimed 50\u00a0kg (110\u00a0lb) in weight.\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).[13]\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution, with the introduction of the Type Porsche 964 (1989\u20131993).\nWhen 911 sales began to decline by the early 1970s, Porsche executives approved work on the Porsche 928 in 1971. Larger, and featuring a front-mounted V8 engine considerably more powerful than the contemporary 911's flat six, the 928 was intended to be a comfortable grand tourer rather than a dedicated sports car. Capable of out-accelerating and even matching or exceeding the 911's cornering prowess in some model years, the 928 sold reasonably well from its introduction in 1977 until its discontinuation in 1995. In spite of its overall capability, it never outsold the 911; and unlike its smaller, sportier sibling, it achieved little success in racing.\nThe Porsche factory's first 911-based race car was a lightly modified 1964 Type 901.  It finished fifth in the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally and is now housed in the Porsche Museum.[14]\nPorsche 911s dominated the Trans Am Series under two liter class in the sixties, winning the championship from 1967-1969. They would later go on to win the championship in 1973, 1974, and 1980. Despite Trans Am being a sedan championship in its early years, the Porsche 911 was a sports car. Its inclusion is likely due to its resemblance to a coup\u00e9.\n", "Porsche 911 GT1": "The Porsche 911 GT1 is a car designed for competition in the GT1 class of sportscar racing, which also required a street legal version for homologation purposes. The limited-production street-legal version was labeled the 911 GT1 Stra\u00dfenversion (Street version).\nWith the revival of international sportscar racing in the mid-1990s, though the BPR Global GT Series (which then morphed into the FIA GT Championship) Porsche expressed interest in returning to top level sportscar racing and went about developing its competitor for the GT1 category. Cars in this category were previously heavily modified versions of road cars, usually supercars such as the McLaren F1 and Ferrari F40.\nHowever, when the 911 GT1 was uneveiled in 1996, Porsche exploited the rule book to the full and stunned the sportscar fraternity. Rather than develop a race version of one of their road going models, what they created was effectively a purpose built sports-prototype, but in order to comply with regulations a street legal version was created, 911 GT1 Stra\u00dfenversion - literally a road-going racing car.\nIn spite of its 911 moniker the car actually had very little in common with the 911 of the time, however its frontal chassis was shared with the then (993) 911, while the rear of the car was derived from the Porsche 962, including its water-cooled, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, four valve per cylinder flat-six engine which was arranged in a mid-mounted position, compared to the rear-engined layout of a conventional 911. The engine was making about 600\u00a0PS (441\u00a0kW; 592\u00a0hp). In comparison, the 993 generation 911 GT2, which was otherwise the company's highest-performance vehicle, used an air-cooled engine with only two valves per cylinder.\nThe new vehicle was an outright success at Le Mans, winning the GT1 class at its debut race, although it lost the overall victory to Joest Racing's Porsche WSC-95 prototype, still a success in that this vehicle used a Porsche powerplant.\nThe 911 GT1 made its debut in the BPR Global GT Series (the FIA championship's predecessor) at the Brands Hatch 4 hours, where Hans-Joachim Stuck and Thierry Boutsen won comfortably, although they were racing as an invited entry and were thus ineligible for points. They followed up by winning at Spa and Ralf Kelleners and Emmanuel Collard triumphed for the factory team at Zhuhai.\nThe '96 GT1 had around 600\u00a0PS (441\u00a0kW) and was clocked at a top speed of exactly 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) on the legendary Mulsanne Straight in the practice sessions of the 1996 Le Mans 24 Hours Race (presumably on a low downforce setup).\n[3] would reference the 1996 Porsche 911 GT1 at Le Mans as 640 bhp. This compares favourably in that race, with the 1996 Ferrari F40 GTE II, (well referenced as 635bhp in race trim,) and the 1996 McLaren F1 GTR, (about 620 - 630).\nIn 1997, the new Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR was successful in the new FIA GT Championship that replaced the BPR, as it was developed for racing. Mercedes did not enter Le Mans yet with their new car, though. The Porsche did not prove to be as fast in the FIA series, and failed to win a single race, first against the McLaren F1 GTR, and then against the new CLK-GTR.\nTowards the end of the 1996 season Porsche made revisions to the 911 GT1 in preparation for the 1997 season. The front end of the car was revised including new bodywork which featured headlamps that previewed the all-new 2nd generation (996) Porsche 911 which would appear in 1997. The revised car was known as the 911 GT1 Evo (or Evolution). As far as performance goes, the car had the same 600\u00a0PS (441\u00a0kW; 592\u00a0hp) turbo-charged engine, but new aerodynamics on the car allowed the '97 car to be considerably faster than the 1996 model - acceleration was better, although the top speed was still around 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) on the La Sarthe Circuit (in the race, the GT1-Evo reached 326\u00a0km/h). However, the works cars suffered from reliability problems and did not last the full race distance; a privately entered 1996 specification GT1 managed 5th overall and third in its class, but was beaten by the BMW-backed and powered McLaren F1 GTRs.\nFor the 1998 season Porsche developed an all-new car, the 911 GT1-98. Designed to match the also new Toyota GT-One and Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR, the 911 GT1-98 featured bodywork which bore more of a resemblance to traditional sports-prototypes than the previous 2 models while a new sequential gearbox was installed. As per the regulations a street-legal version of the 911 GT1-98 was spawned, but it is believed that only one variant was produced which was still sufficient to satisfy the regulations.\nDuring the 1998 FIA International GT season the 911 GT1-98 struggled to match the pace of the Mercedes, which also were improved, with the main reason being down to the air-restrictor rules being which were regarded as unfavourable to the turbo engine (the Mercedes being naturally aspirated). The Michelin tyres of the factory team and especially the Pirelli of the private Zakspeed team were also considered inferior to the Bridgestone of Mercedes.\nAt the 1998 Le Mans however, it was a different story. The BMW V12 LM retired with wheel bearing trouble, and the Mercedes CLK-LM vehicles had oil pump troubles in the new V8 engines that replaced the former V12. The Toyota GT-One, which was considered to be the fastest car, also suffered gearbox reliability problems.\nThe 911 GT1-98, despite being slower than the Toyota or the Mercedes, fulfilled Porsche's slim hopes, taking both first and second place overall thanks to reliability, giving Porsche its record-breaking 16th overall win at Le Mans, more than any other manufacturer in history.\nAt Petit Le Mans race in Road Atlanta, the 911 GT1 '98 of Yannick Dalmas made a spectacular backward flip and landed rear first before hitting the side barriers, as did the BMW V12 LMR at the same race in 2000, and most infamously the Mercedes-Benz CLR at Le Mans in 1999.\nThe GT1 '98 was set up with higher downforce in the race than the previous two years, which reduced its race maximum speed to 310\u00a0km/h (193\u00a0mph). However, in the 1998 Le Mans 24 Hours test days, the car hit 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) on the Mulsanne Straight on a lower downforce setup.\nWith Mercedes dominating FIA GT1 in 1998, all other entries including Porsche withdrew for 1999. The GT1 class was cancelled, and the FIA GT Championship was contested with GT2 cars. Porsche could have entered at Le Mans, but chose not to try to defend the win of '98 against new machines from other factories.\nChampion Racing brought a 911 GT1 Evo to America to race in the American Le Mans Series, but was only allowed to do so as an LMP (Le Mans Prototypes) class entry, where it proved uncompetitive against actual prototypes such as the BMW V12 LMR.\nFollowing Champion's purchase of a 911 GT1 Evo for 1999, Gunnar Racing offered a custom race car to the team with intentions to race in 2000.  The car, known as the Gunnar G-99, was a custom-built 911 GT1 with an open cockpit.  The chassis was made from scratch yet remained nearly identical to the 911 GT1 mechanically, even using the bulk of the bodyparts.  A large rollbar was put over the open cockpit to help protect the driver.  A 3.6 litre flat-6 from a Porsche 911 GT3 was used in place of the standard 911 GT1 unit.\nHowever, Champion would instead turn to buying a Lola B2K/10, so the Gunnar G-99 was temporarily abandoned.  The car would resurface in the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2002, yet would not be allowed to race until it had a roof again.  Therefore, Gunnar Racing rebuilt the car with a near identical GT1 roof, and briefly competed in 2003.  The car would take a best finish of second in class twice before being retired due to lack of funding, and the ban on SRP cars in favour of Daytona Prototypes.\nRegulations for the GT1 category stipulated that to be eligible, a total of 25 cars must be built for road use. Porsche developed two fully road-legal versions, dubbed \"911 GT1 Stra\u00dfenversion\", and delivered one in early 1996 to the German government for compliance testing, which it passed. The second vehicle is in the hands of Bahrain-based private collector Khalid Abdul Rahim. These two vehicles feature 993 style front headlights. A further 20 units were built in 1997 with 996 style front headlights.\nThe engine had to be slightly de-tuned to meet European emissions laws, although its 400\u00a0kW (544\u00a0PS; 536\u00a0hp) @ 7200 rpm and 600\u00a0N\u22c5m (443\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) rpm @ 4250 of torque proved to be more than adequate; the vehicle could accelerate to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) from a standstill in 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 308\u00a0km/h (191\u00a0mph).[4]\nAuto, Motor und Sport tested the street-legal version in 1997 with the following results:\n", "Porsche 911 GT2": "The Porsche 911 GT2 is a high-performance sports car built by the German manufacturer Porsche from 1993 to 1998, 2001 to 2005, 2007 to 2012, and then since 2018 (as the GT2 RS). It is based on the 911 Turbo, and uses a similar twin-turbocharged engine, but features numerous upgrades, including engine upgrades, larger brakes, and stiffer suspension calibration.  The GT2 is significantly lighter than the Turbo due to its use of rear-wheel-drive instead of all-wheel-drive and the reduction or removal of interior components. As a result, the GT2 (now GT2 RS) is the most expensive and fastest model among the 911 lineup with a 0-60mph time of 2.7 seconds.\nThe 993-generation GT2 was initially built in order to meet homologation requirements for motorsports.  Because the cars were built to meet the GT2 class regulations, the road cars were named accordingly.[1]  The 993 GT2 featured widened plastic fenders and a larger rear wing with air scoops in the struts.  The 993 GT2's original 3.6\u00a0L (220\u00a0cu\u00a0in) engine developed 316\u00a0kW (424\u00a0hp); in 1998 it was upgraded to 331\u00a0kW (444\u00a0hp). 57 road cars were built (thirteen of which were right-hand drive).[2]\nIn 1995, this Porsche had a Safety Car in Formula One role, most notably at the Belgian Grand Prix.\nIn 1999, the 993-generation 911 was replaced with the new 996 model.  It would be two years before a new GT2 model would arrive; during that time, Porsche decided to abandon the GT2 for motorsports use, instead concentrating on the new naturally aspirated 911 GT3.\nDeveloped primarily as a road car in contrast to its predecessor, the new GT2 featured a twin-turbocharged version of the GT3's 3.6\u00a0L (220\u00a0cu\u00a0in) H6 engine. It featured an output of 462\u00a0PS (340\u00a0kW; 456\u00a0hp), which was later increased to 483\u00a0PS (355\u00a0kW; 476\u00a0hp). Like the 993 GT2, its body differed significantly from those of other 996 variants; major differences included wider fenders, a more aggressively shaped nose, and a large rear wing.\nAccording to road testing performed by Car and Driver magazine, the GT2 suffers from hardly any turbo lag.  Despite a 10-millimeter reduction in ride height from the 911 Turbo, the drag coefficient is slightly higher \u2014 0.34 Cd vs. the Turbo's 0.33 \u2014 due to the fixed rear wing.[3]\n[4]\nThe Porsche 996 GT2 was superseded by the 997 GT2 in 2007 after a brief hiatus, with cars arriving at dealerships in November[6] after an official launch at the 62nd Frankfurt Motor Show.\nThe 997 GT2 engine was based on the existing 3.6\u00a0L (220\u00a0cu\u00a0in) flat-6 engine, but featured twin variable geometry turbochargers, which generated 530\u00a0PS (390\u00a0kW; 523\u00a0hp) at 6500\u00a0rpm and 680\u00a0N\u22c5m (500\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) at 2200\u00a0rpm.  The GT2 accelerated from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (0-62\u00a0mph) in 3.6 seconds and on to 200\u00a0km/h (124\u00a0mph) in 10.6 seconds, and had a maximum top speed of 204\u00a0mph (328\u00a0km/h). This made it the third Porsche  to exceed the 322\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) barrier, with the exception of the 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 (of which only 20 vehicles were produced for street use,[7] solely to satisfy ACO homologation requirements for racing).\nThe American auto magazine Motor Trend tested a 2008 Porsche 911 GT2, achieving a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 3.3 seconds,[8] and a quarter mile of 11.3 seconds at 129.1\u00a0mph (207.8\u00a0km/h).  The GT2 also recorded a braking distance from 60 to 0\u00a0mph of 98 feet (30\u00a0m), and 1.10g of lateral grip.\nThe appearance of the 997 GT2 once again differed from its sister car, the 997 Turbo. It had a revised front lip, newly designed rear wing with two small air inlets on either side, and a revised rear bumper featuring titanium exhaust pipes and shark fin outlets.\nGerman Porsche test driver Walter R\u00f6hrl lapped the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife on a public day in 7 minutes, 32 seconds in the 997 GT2.\nA total of 194 units were sold in the United States and 19 units in Canada.[9]\nTechnical specifications of the standard 997 GT2:[10]\nOn May 4, 2010, an RS variant was announced to German dealers in Leipzig. The GT2 RS developed 620\u00a0PS (456\u00a0kW; 612\u00a0hp) and 700\u00a0N\u22c5m (516\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque and weighs 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb) less than the standard GT2, allowing for a top speed of 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) and 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0-62\u00a0mph) acceleration of 3.5 seconds.[11]\nAccording to Porsche Motorsports manager Andreas Preuninger, the RS was conceived around 2007 as a skunk-works effort. The 727 code number selected for the project corresponds to one of the Nissan GT-R's lap times around the Nurburgring's Nordschleife. When the dust settled, Porsche claimed that test driver Timo Kluck had supposedly eclipsed that target by an impressive nine seconds.\nA total of 131 units were sold in the United States and 10 units in Canada.[12]\nThe 991 version of the 911 GT2 RS was initially unveiled at the Xbox 2017 E3 briefing along with the announcement of the Forza Motorsport 7 video game where it was revealed as cover car as well as included as a playable vehicle. \nThe car was officially launched by Porsche at the 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed along with the introduction of the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. The 991 GT2 RS is powered by a 3.8\u00a0L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine that produces a maximum power of 700\u00a0PS (515\u00a0kW; 690\u00a0hp) at 7,000 rpm and 750\u00a0N\u22c5m (550\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque, making it the most powerful 911 ever built. Unlike the previous GT2 versions, this car is fitted with a 7-speed PDK transmission to handle the excessive torque produced from the engine. Porsche claims that this car will accelerate from 0 to 60\u00a0mph in 2.7\u00a0seconds, and has a top speed of 340\u00a0km/h (210\u00a0mph).\nThe car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, front and rear wings and boot lid made of carbon, front and rear apron made of lightweight polyurethane, rear and side windows made of polycarbonate and features a titanium exhaust system. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of 1,470\u00a0kg.\nA Weissach package option is available, which reduces 30\u00a0kg of weight, thanks to the additional use of carbon-fiber and titanium parts. This includes the roof, the anti-roll bars and the coupling rods on both axles made out of carbon-fiber while the package also includes a set of magnesium wheels. The car has a MSRP of US$293,200 and was available in the United States from early 2018.[13]\nIn late September 2017, the GT2 RS made a 6:47.3 lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring, averaging a speed of 184.11 km/h. This makes it the fastest production car lap time recorded on the track.[14]\nThe Porsche GT2 comes from a long line of 911 Porsche Turbo racing cars in international motorsports. Starting with the 1974 911 Carrera turbo for Group5 racing, followed by the 934 (a racing version of the 930) for Group4 racing, then the famous Porsche 935 which dominated Group5 and IMSA racing through 1984. In 1986 a Porsche 961 (racing version of the 959) would be created with little racing success but a leap forward in technology and development such as AWD, 4 valves per cylinder and water-cooled heads (which first appeared in the 1978 Porsche 935 Moby-Dick, used in the Porsche 956/962 GroupC prototypes and then in the 959/961). In 1993, Porsche had experimented with the extensively modified turbo 964, named the Turbo S LM-GT.  Seeing the car's potential to be fast and reliable, as well as customer demand for a car to replace the 964 Carrera RSRs, Porsche chose to develop the turbocharged 993 for customer use.\nThe 993 GT2 race car featured a stripped interior, integrated rollcage for safety, minor adjustments to the bodywork and wings in order to decrease weight as well as increase downforce, and wider fenders to handle racing slicks.  The suspension was modified to improve racing performance, while the engine was slightly tweaked for endurance.  Twin KKK turbochargers, fitted with required air restrictors, allowed for 335.7\u00a0kW (450\u00a0hp).[1]\nAt the same time, Porsche also developed a GT2 Evo, able to race in the GT1 category.  The Evo saw an increase in power to 447.6\u00a0kW (600\u00a0hp) through the use of larger turbochargers.  Other modifications included a new, higher-mounted rear wing, larger fenders to house the wider tires allowed in the GT1 class, and a decrease in weight to 1,100\u00a0kg (2,425\u00a0lb).[15]  The GT2 Evo was short-lived, however, as Porsche decided to replace it with the purpose-built 911 GT1 in 1996.\nThe GT2 and GT2 Evos were initially campaigned in the BPR Global GT Series as well as several other smaller national series, and earned seven wins in their class out of eleven rounds during their first full BPR season in 1996, as well as a class victory in the 1996 and 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans.  In the new FIA GT Championship that year, although Porsche faced factory-backed competition from Chrysler, the 911 GT2s managed to win three races.  By 1998, however, the capabilities of the GT2 were unable to combat the increased number of Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs in the series, earning only a single victory.\nBy 1999, the GT2s had been largely overpowered by the Vipers, as well as newcomers Lister.  Despite this, a GT2 prepared by Roock Racing managed to win the GT2 class at the 24 Hours of Daytona.  An increase in engine displacement to 3.8\u00a0liters in 2000 was unable to help Porsche, and support for the project ended.  Porsche chose instead to concentrate on the new N-GT category with the GT3-R that same year.  GT2s continued to be used by private teams until 2004.\nWith the launch of the 996 generation GT2, several privateers attempted to continue on the motorsports history by building their own racing versions.  Belgian PSI Motorsports' 911 Bi-Turbo and German A-Level Engineering's 911 GT2-R were used with mixed success in national series such as Belcar, but were not competitive in international series.\n", "Porsche 911 GT3": "The Porsche 911 GT3 is a high performance version of the Porsche 911 sports car primarily intended for racing. It is a line of high-performance models, which began with the 1973 911 Carrera RS. The GT3, introduced in 1999, is named after the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Group GT3 class, in which it was designed to compete.\nA number of variations, designed for road and track duty, have been introduced since its launch in 1999. More than 14,000 cars have been produced.\nThe GT3 has had a successful racing career in the one-make national and regional Porsche Carrera Cup and GT3 Cup Challenge series, as well as the international Porsche Supercup supporting the FIA Formula 1 World Championship. It has won championship and endurance races, including the GT class of the American Le Mans Series seven times, first overall in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and first overall at the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring six times.[citation needed]\nThe \"GT3\" nameplate was introduced in 1999 as part of the first generation of the Porsche 996 model range (commonly known as 996.1[1]). As with Porsche's previous 911 RS models, the 996 GT3 was focused on racing, and so was devoid of items that added unnecessary weight to the car.  Sound deadening was almost completely removed, as were the rear seats, rear loud speakers, sunroof, and air conditioning, although automatic air conditioning and CD/radio became no-cost optional add-ons.\nThe engine of the 996 GT3 set it apart from most of the other Porsche 996 models, although it shared the same basic design of the standard so-called \"integrated dry sump\" flat-six engine. The engine is naturally aspirated and based on the unit used in the Porsche 962 and Porsche 911 GT1 race cars. That engine was known as the 'Mezger' engine, after its designer Hans Mezger. The engine uses the original air-cooled 911's versatile dry-sump crankcase, with an external oil reservoir. The 996 GT3 has 360\u00a0PS (265\u00a0kW; 355\u00a0hp), compared to the 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW; 296\u00a0hp) of the regular Porsche 996. In GT3 configuration, this so-called \"split\" crankcase (meaning the parting line of crankcase is on the crankshaft centreline) uses, instead of a fan and finned cylinders, separate water jackets added onto each side of the crankcase to cool banks of three cylinders with water pumped through a radiator. Thus, the GT3 engine is very similar to the completely water-cooled Porsche 962 racing car's engine, which is based on the same crankcase. The 962 differs, however, by using six individual cylinder heads while the GT1/GT3, like the air and water-cooled Porsche 959, uses two cylinder heads, each covering a bank of three cylinders. The GT3 engine could thus also be thought of as similar to a 959 engine, but with water-cooled cylinders. Up to early model year 2004 996 GT3 production, the basic casting used for the crankcase of the GT3 was the same as the air-cooled engine.  The \"964\" casting number was visible on the bottom of the crankcase, and on areas normally machined in air-cooled applications, but not in water-cooled ones. The crankcase casting was changed in mid-2004 to a \"996\" casting number crankcase to eliminate these external air-cooled remnants, but internally it was the same.\nBecause the 911 air-cooled crankcase uses the Porsche 356 engine to transmission mounting flange configuration, the 996 GT3 used a manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. This gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios and is more durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard 911 type 996 gearbox.\nTo bring the vehicle's track-prowess to the maximum level, Porsche endowed the GT3 with enlarged brakes, a lowered, re-tuned suspension system, lighter-weight wheels and a new front bumper with matched rear spoiler to help increase downforce, thereby increasing grip.\nPorsche offered a no-cost option for the GT3 called the 'Clubsport' package.  This option replaced the standard electrically adjustable leather front seats with manually adjustable racing buckets finished in fire-retardant fabric, single mass flywheel, bolt-in half-roll cage, 6-point drivers racing harness (also replacing the standard side airbags), fire extinguisher (mounted in the front passenger footwell) and preparation for a battery master switch. The Clubsport option was never offered to US customers, ostensibly due to the additional DOT crash testing that would have been required to allow US sales.\nPorsche made significant updates to the GT3 for 2004 (the first year the car was offered to US customers), using the 2002 996 facelift including headlights that were differentiated from the Porsche Boxster. The 2004 version is commonly known as the 996.2 GT3.[2] Horsepower was raised to 381\u00a0PS (280\u00a0kW) and torque to 284\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (385\u00a0N\u22c5m), 80% of which was available from 2,000 rpm.  The braking setup was upgraded, now featuring 6-piston calipers on the front (rears remained 4-piston), and the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake system was offered as an option.\nIn track testing by American automotive journals, the GT3 managed a 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) time of 4.5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 12.0 seconds at 118 miles per hour (190\u00a0km/h).  During skidpad testing the vehicle posted 1.03g.\nPorsche's official test-driver Walter R\u00f6hrl completed the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife with the 996 GT3 in 7 minutes 56 seconds, a feat which was used by Porsche to promote the car.\n1999 Porsche 996 GT3 (pre-facelift) front.\n1999 Porsche 996 GT3 (pre-facelift) rear.\nPorsche 996 GT3 (post-facelift) front.\n2005 Porsche 996 GT3 (post-facelift) rear.\nIn 2003, Porsche introduced the Porsche 911 GT3 RS, an even more track-focused version of the 996 GT3. RS is short for the German RennSport, literally \"racing sport\" in English. The \"RS\" moniker, and the characteristic lightweight blue or red wheels and \"GT3 RS\" side stickers link the 996 GT3 RS to historically important Porsches such as the Carrera 2.7 RS of the early 1970s. The 996 GT3 RS is lighter than the 996 GT3 thanks to a polycarbonate rear window, carbon fiber hood and rear wing.  Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite brakes, which are also more heat and fade resistant than the cast iron units fitted as standard, are optional.\nThe 996 GT3 RS has a slightly different engine specification to the 996 GT3. The cylinder heads of the 996 GT3 RS have reshaped intake and exhaust ports for race homologation. Porsche claim the same 381\u00a0hp (284\u00a0kW) power output as the standard GT3 but Porsche's control dyno showed a jump to nearly 400\u00a0hp (298\u00a0kW) The RS also has progressive springs rather than linear. The dampers are uprated and are between 10 and 15 percent stiffer than the 996 GT3 in bounce and rebound.\nThe wheel carriers are totally redesigned to maximize the improved dynamic camber control. The suspension top mounts can be turned 120 degrees to a cup car position. Both front and rear control arms are adjustable. The RS is 3\u00a0mm (0.1\u00a0in) lower than the 996 GT3.\nThe RS rear wing delivers 35\u00a0kg (77\u00a0lb) of downforce at 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). The RS has ram air ducts on the engine bay which force air into the intake with 18mb of pressure at 187\u00a0mph (301\u00a0km/h) and this is enough to create an additional 15\u00a0bhp (11\u00a0kW; 15\u00a0PS). That extra bhp cannot be homologated since the official engine output figures are certified on a dynanometer.\nThe Porsche 996 GT3 RS had a production run from 2003 to 2005. Only 140 right hand drive 996 GT3 RS cars were built by Porsche and 113 of those were officially imported into the UK. The 996 GT3 RS was not sold in the United States or Canada.\nAutomobile magazines claim the 996 GT3 RS can accelerate from 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in about 4.3 seconds, maintain over 1.0g on the skidpad, and have a top speed of around 190\u00a0mph (306\u00a0km/h).\nPorsche 996 GT3 RS front.\nPorsche 996 GT3 RS rear.\nIn February 2006, Porsche revealed the first generation 997 GT3, commonly now known as the 997.1 GT3.[3] In addition to a new 415\u00a0PS (305\u00a0kW) 3.6 litre flat-six engine, the vehicle featured \"zero lift\" aerodynamics, meaning the car creates only aerodynamic downforce and no grip-diminishing \"lift\" upwards and away from the road surface.  The vehicle made use of a modified, track oriented version of Porsche's active PASM suspension making it the first of Porsche's RS or GT3 versions to feature an electronically adjustable suspension system. Also available was a navigation system and Porsche's \"sports chrono\" gauge package. The car went to sale in summer of 2006 and had a starting price of $106,000 USD. A total of 917 units were sold in the United States and 46 units in Canada.\nThe vehicle has a rated 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) time of 4.1 seconds and has a top speed of 193\u00a0mph (311\u00a0km/h).  Road and Track was able to achieve a 0-60\u00a0mph run in 3.8 seconds.[4] Porsche's official test-driver Walter R\u00f6hrl completed the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in 7 minutes 42 seconds with the 997 GT3 in 2006.\n2006 Porsche 997 GT3 (pre-facelift) front.\n2006 Porsche 997 GT3 (pre-facelift) rear.\nPorsche also offered an RS version of the 997 GT3. In common with its predecessors, it provided a homologation model for use in a range of racing series. The 997 GT3 RS was released in Europe in October 2006 and in North America in spring 2007.\nThe 997 GT3 RS is 20\u00a0kg (44\u00a0lb) lighter than the 997 GT3, weighing in at 1,370[5]\u00a0kg (3,020\u00a0lb). This weight-saving was achieved by the use of an adjustable carbon plastic wing, a steel engine cover, and a lightweight plastic windscreen.  The weight savings gives the 997 GT3 RS corresponding engine power to curb weight ratio of 300\u00a0bhp (220\u00a0kW) per tonne.\nThe body of the 997 GT3 RS is 64\u00a0mm (2.5\u00a0in) wider at the rear than the 997 GT3 (a legacy from the Carrera 4 models with which it shares its shell).  The muscular-looking rear end conceals a wider track that not only improves directional stability but also increases the potential cornering grip. However, drag is increased and top speed reduced due to the larger rear wing. In addition to the new technology, the paint scheme and body panels are all designed specifically for this car. For the RS version, the limited edition RS Green and RS Orange colour was formulated specially for this car.\nThe US version of the 997 GT3 RS has a standard rear window (not plexiglas) and the smaller 911 fuel tank to comply with rules of SCCA, Can-Am, and IMSA. For Grand-Am races, the central locking wheel nut is replaced with the standard five-lug pattern required under Grand-Am rules.\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS (997.1 GT3 RS[6]) ended in 2009. An estimated 1,168 vehicles were delivered worldwide, with a total of 410 units sold in the United States and 42 units in Canada.[7]\nPorsche 997 GT3 RS (pre-facelift) front.\nPorsche 997 GT3 RS (pre-facelift) rear.\nIn 2009, Porsche launched the 2nd Generation 997 GT3 (commonly now known as the 997.2 GT3[8]), with an enlarged 3.8 litre engine producing 435\u00a0PS (320\u00a0kW). It also featured a number of new options including dynamic engine mounts and a pneumatically lifting front axle to compensate for the low ground clearance. The rear spoiler was also modified along with other parts of the bodywork. Deliveries in Europe commenced in November the same year. A total of 65 units were sold in the United States and 58 units in Canada.\nPorsche 997 GT3 3.8 (post-facelift) front.\nPorsche 997 GT3 (post-facelift) 3.8 rear\nFor 2010, the second generation 911 GT3 RS (known as 997.2 GT3 RS[9]) received an additional 15\u00a0PS (11\u00a0kW; 15\u00a0hp) due to a new 3.8-litre flat-6 engine, bringing total power output up to 450\u00a0hp (336\u00a0kW; 450\u00a0hp). The car was not approved for competition in the United States by IMSA American LeMans.  Grand-Am originally did not approve the car, but after performance issues (a Porsche team did not compete at the Indy Grand Prix of Alabama round), Grand-Am approved the second-generation car in April 2010.[10][11]\nFifth Gear carried out a road test on the 997 911 GT3 RS which highlighted the exceptional performance of the car[12]\nPorsche test driver had intended[13] to enter the 2011 12 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring on a standard road legal 911 GT3 RS, but had to withdraw due to health reasons from the team that comprised racers Roland Asch and Simon Cowell, plus journalists Horst von Saurma and Chris Harris. The car, entered in cooperation with sport auto (Germany),[14] is registered as S-GO 2400, and was driven from Weissach to N\u00fcrburg. The RS was modified according to safety requirements, which included a larger roll cage and fire extinguisher. As no race tyres were available for 19\" wheels, the 18\" wheels of the Carrera Cup racers were used. Asch qualified with 9:15, 42nd overall, and 9th[15] among the 17 SP7 class entrants, only beaten by its race-prepared Porsche 997 siblings. In an otherwise disappointing race for Porsche, with the best race 997 finishing only 6th, the road legal car did 145 laps, only 9 less than the winning BMW, for place 13.[16] It supposedly had to cover another 306\u00a0km, on the Autobahn back home.\nOf the 997.2 GT3 RS a total of 541 units sold in the United States and 71 units in Canada.\nPorsche 997 GT3 RS (post-facelift) front.\n2010 Porsche 997 GT3 RS (post-facelift) rear.\nThe 911 GT3 RS 4.0, launched in 2011, was the final evolution of the 997 GT3 and featured a 4.0 litre flat-six engine (the largest engine offered in a street-legal 911).[17] The engine itself uses the crankshaft from the RSR with increased stroke dimensions (from 76.4\u00a0mm to 80.4\u00a0mm). This change has increased the power to 368\u00a0kW (500\u00a0PS; 493\u00a0hp) at 8250 rpm and 460\u00a0N\u22c5m (339\u00a0lbf\u22c5ft) of torque at 5750 rpm. Chassis development has been influenced by the GT2 RS and uses parts from other RS 911s. Front dive planes give additional downforce up front. The car weighs in at 1,360\u00a0kg (2,998\u00a0lb),[18] giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 365\u00a0bhp per ton. Only 600 cars were built.[17][19] At 493\u00a0hp (368\u00a0kW),[20] the engine is one of the most powerful six-cylinder naturally aspirated engines in any production car with a 123.25\u00a0hp (92\u00a0kW) per litre output.\nPerformance is 3.5 seconds for 0-60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) and a top speed of 193\u00a0mph (311\u00a0km/h).[21] The lap time on the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife is 7 minutes and 27 seconds.[22]\nThe car was offered in Black, Carrera White, Paint to Sample Non Metallic and Paint to Sample Metallic. A total of 141 units were sold in the United States and 16 units in Canada.\n2011 Porsche 997 GT3 RS 4.0 front.\nPorsche 997 GT3 RS 4.0 rear.\nPorsche introduced the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013.[23] The 991 GT3 features a new 3.8 litre direct fuel injection (DFI) flat-six engine developing 475\u00a0hp (354\u00a0kW; 482\u00a0PS) at 8,250 rpm, a Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) double-clutch gearbox and rear-wheel steering. The engine is based on the unit fitted in the 991 Carrera S, but shares only a few common parts. All other components, particularly the crankshaft and valve train, were specially adapted or developed for the 991 GT3.[24] For example, the 991 GT3's engine uses titanium connecting rods attached to forged piston, in order to allow the engine to reach up to 9,000 rpm. The dual-clutch gearbox is another feature specially developed for the 991 GT3, based on sequential manual transmissions used in racing cars.[25]\nAfter a number of engine failures, it was discovered that the supplier of the connecting rod bolts had made a production error in the alloy of the bolt.[26] Subsequently, all 785 of the GT3s that had been produced up to that point were recalled to the dealership organisations and fitted with new engines, and all owners were issued with an extra year's warranty.[27]\nA formal letter sent to Porsche from members of the US-based Rennlist.com \"991.1 GT3 Concerned Owners Group\" about additional engine durability issues lead to a meeting between representatives of the owners group and Porsche, including head of Porsche Motorsport Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser, on 3 August 2017 at the Porsche North America Atlanta headquarters. According to Dr. Walliser the concerning high-RPM misfire issue could be traced primarily to a metallurgical defect in certain batches of \"finger followers\" (valve train rocker arms) and secondarily to individual driving patterns and engine variations - such as temperature, oil quality, oil viscosity and parts tolerances - that lead to increased wear of the specific parts. In response to the issue and after implementing new engine tests to trace down the issue Porsche had developed revised camshafts and finger followers and offers a fully transferable 10-year, 120,000 mile extended engine warranty to all 991.1 generation GT3 owners worldwide that covers the replacement of the defective engine with a new engine with the revised parts if failure is a direct result of the finger-follower issue. The base bumper-to-bumper warranty and all other warranty terms and conditions remain unchanged. Porsche confirms that the issue is isolated to the 991.1 GT3, and that the 991.1 GT3 RS and the 991 R are not affected.[28][29][30][31]\nThe 911 GT3 is claimed to be able to accelerate from 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.1 seconds or less, and the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds at 126\u00a0mph (203\u00a0km/h).[32][33] The GT3 has a claimed top speed of 202\u00a0mph (325\u00a0km/h). The lap time on the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife is 7 minutes and 25 seconds.[34]\nPorsche launched the RS version of the 911 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[35] Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket).The car was nominated as one of the Britain's best driver's car 2014 by Autocar magazine.\nThe 3.8-litre unit found in the 911 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit with 500 horsepower and 339 pound-feet (460\u00a0N\u00b7m) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The drivetrain delivers 0-62\u00a0mph (0\u2013100\u00a0km/h) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0-124\u00a0mph (0\u2013200\u00a0km/h) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013- and Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, there is rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock. The N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife time is 7 minutes and 20 seconds.[36]\nPorsche unveiled the facelifted 991.2 GT3 at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a  manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission.\nGT3 Touring\nFollowing the roots of the 2016 911R, a touring version of the GT3 was introduced that removes the rear wing and replaces it with the rear spoiler from the Carrera GTS to give a more smooth and flowing aesthetic image, though it extends further upwards to provide extra downforce. The Touring is only available with a manual transmission, features leather versus alcantara, and cannot be specified with the Clubsport package available with the normal GT3. The suspension settings are said to be identical to the standard GT3 as is the engine. The touring, unlike the 911R is not produced in limited numbers therefore discouraging high price speculation.\nIn February 2018, Porsche revealed a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and 20\u00a0PS (15\u00a0kW; 20\u00a0bhp) and 10\u00a0N\u22c5m (7.4\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) increase over the previous GT3 RS, NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2 GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the GT2 RS) for increased downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs, lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed tyre compound. A Weissach package including additional carbon fibre body and interior parts as well as magnesium wheels and stiffer suspension settings is available as an option.[37]\nOn 18 April 2018 the 991.2 GT3 RS set a lap time of 6:56.4 around the infamous N\u00fcrburgring Nordscheleife race track. It is the third Porsche production car to break the 7 minute barrier around the track, the first being the 918 Spyder.[38]\nThe following race versions were or are offered:\nThe 997 is a Porsche Carrera Cup race car based on 911 GT3 RS. It includes 44\u00a0mm (1.7\u00a0in) wider rear body, 15\u00a0mm (0.59\u00a0in) lower front spoiler lip, 1.70\u00a0m (67\u00a0in) rear wing (from 911 GT3 Cup S race car), LED taillights, racing exhaust system with a fully controlled catalytic converter, a modified special exhaust system offering more dynamic and muscular sound (from Porsche Mobil1 Supercup cars), Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. 9.5Jx18 front alloy wheels with 24/64-18 Michelin racing tyres and 12Jx18 alloy wheels with 27/68-18 tyres, additional Unibal joints on the track control arms and front and rear sword-shaped anti-roll bars with seven position settings each, additional vent in the upper part of the front lid, steering wheel mounted Info Display with 6 switches, Carrara White body. The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.\nProduction model began delivery in 2009\u201310. European model has base MSRP of \u20ac149,850 (before tax).[55]\nThe new Porsche 997 GT3 R Hybrid made its debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The hybrid technology featured in the car was developed by the Williams F1 Team and is based on their F1 kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) which they did not race in 2009.[56]  Unlike other KERS that were developed for F1, the Williams system is based on using kinetic energy stored in a flywheel rather than batteries. The GT3-R has two electric motors, both developing a total output of at least 218 brake horsepower (163\u00a0kW), driving the front wheels to supplement the 500 brake horsepower (370\u00a0kW) four-litre flat-six engine at the rear.[57] It is planned to enter the car in the 2010 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring.[58][59] As part of the buildup to the 24 hour race the GT3 Hybrid made its racing debut at the VLN 4 hour endurance 57th ADAC Westfalenfahrt at N\u00fcrburgring on March 27, 2010.[60] On May 28, 2011, it won its first VLN race.[61] At the 2011 24 Hours of Nurburgring, weight/restrictor penalties as well as technical difficulties prevented the R Hybrid from climbing higher than 28th place. The car also ran as an unclassified car at the 2011 American Le Mans Series at Monterey event; despite starting from last place, it finished ahead of all the other GT cars and also performed the fastest GT lap of the race.\nThe Porsche 997 GT3 RSR was developed for the GT2 category and has a dry weight of 1,220\u00a0kg (2,690\u00a0lb) and 563\u00a0bhp (420\u00a0kW; 571\u00a0PS).[62] In 2007 Porsche had also installed front air louvers that channel air into the radiators and exit through the bonnet. For 2011 Porsche added splitters to the front and increased the tyre diameter to cope with the understeer problem. The 997 GT3 RSR has scored many class victories around the world, including first-place finishes at the 2011 and 2013 Petit Le Mans. The 997 GT3 RSR set a N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife lap time record for non-turbocharged cars at 7:07 while driven by Sabine Schmitz.[63]\nPorsche introduced the 991 GT3 Cup for the 2013 Porsche Supercup season, based on the 991 GT3. Like the 991 GT3 road car, its improvements over the 997 model include revised aerodynamics, an improved rollcage, new wheels and a revised chassis. The direct-injection 3.8-litre flat six produces 338\u00a0kW at 8500\u00a0rpm and drives the rear wheels through a mechanical limited slip diff. The transmission includes a paddle-shift, race-bred, pneumatically-activated six speed developed specifically for the track. It uses lightweight materials in its construction, and a stripped-out cabin complete with a full roll cage, racing seat and all the safety gear required for competition, weighing 1175\u00a0kg.[64]\nIn 2013, Porsche introduced the newest version of the RSR based on the 991 model for the LM GTE category.[65] Because the 991 GT3 was not in production at the time of the announcement, Porsche was forced to homologate it based on the 911 Carrera model. The 991 RSR includes revised aerodynamics, a lighter gearbox and a new, lower suspension.[66] For the 2013 season, Porsche retained the Mezger engine of the 997 GT3 RSR model. Manthey Racing was chosen to run the cars in the FIA World Endurance Championship; the team achieved its best success at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans where the 991 RSR finished 1-2 in the GT class.[67]\nFor 2014, Porsche announced that it partnered with CORE Autosport to run two Porsche 911 RSRs in the United SportsCar Championship (under the Porsche North America team name) while AKB GT Raceline has announced that they would run a pair of 911 RSRs in the series. Team Falken Tire also announced that it would be running a 911 RSR from Sebring onwards. Manthey Racing will continue to run two 911 RSRs in the WEC.\nPorsche also announced a variant of the 991 GT3 Cup car for the United SportsCar Championship known as the 911 GT America.[68] The car is homologated exclusively for the Grand-Touring Daytona category of the series. Upgrades over the regular Cup car include improved aerodynamics, a bigger 4.0L flat-six engine, a new gearbox, a different safety cell, new brakes and reliability upgrades for endurance racing.\nIn May 2015, Porsche announced the release of the 991 GT3 R, a customer race car designed to compete in Group GT3 from 2016 onwards. The car is homologated based on the 991 GT3 RS road car, and uses the production car's 4.0-litre flat-six with around 500\u00a0bhp, running through a six-speed paddle-shift sequential gearbox. The GT3 R features a double-bubble roof, and a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 8.3\u00a0cm. Engineers also \"significantly optimised\" the centre of gravity position versus the old R, using carbon-fibre composite material (CFRP) for the roof, front cover and fairing, wheel arches, doors, side and tail sections as well as the rear cover. All windows \u2013 and for the first time ever, the windscreen \u2013 are made from polycarbonate to cut weight. Race car essentials such as an integrated (welded) roll cage according to FIA Appendix J, safety fuel cell (approximately 120 litres, with fuel cut off safety valve in accordance with FIA regulations), removable roof escape hatch and an air jack system are present. The weight is 1,220\u00a0kg.\nThe GT3 R has adopted the concept of the central radiator from its 911 RSR big brother. By eliminating the side radiators, the position of the centre of gravity is improved, the radiator is better protected against collision damage, and the venting of hot air through louvres in the front cover is enhanced. The two-metre wide rear wing lends aerodynamic balance and distinctive wheel arch air vents on the front fairings increase downforce at the front axle. The GT3 R's front MacPherson strut suspension and multi-link rear suspension are adjustable in height, camber and toe, and there are adjustable anti-roll bar blades at both ends. All wheel hubs come with centre-lock wheel nuts. There are two separate brake circuits for the front and rear axles; driver adjustable via a brake balance bar system. The front brakes consist of six-piston aluminium monobloc calipers gripping 380\u00a0mm discs; the rears are four-piston items with 372\u00a0mm discs.[69]\nThe Porsche 911 GT3 R is priced 429,000 Euro excluding country-specific taxes.\nIn November 2016, Porsche revealed the new version of the 911 RSR prepared for the LM GTE category. The car has a rear mid-engined design, powered by a four-liter flat-six boxer engine,  producing around 510\u00a0PS (375\u00a0kW; 503\u00a0bhp) depending on series air restrictor. Other new features include a new transmission, a new aerodynamic pack including a swan-neck wing and a larger rear diffuser, quick-change body panels and double-wishbone suspension with quick-change shim-system all around, Bertrandt-developed LED lights first developed for the Porsche 919 Hybrid and new cockpit with fixed seat, movable pedal box, multi-function steering wheel with integrated display, a rear-view camera and collision avoidance system. The new RSR made its competition debut at the 2017 24 Hours of Daytona.[70][71]\nAt the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans the Manthey Racing-entered Porsche Team 911 RSR #92 and #91 finished 1-2 in the GTE Pro class respectively. Both #92 and #91 carried a special liveries marking the 70th anniversary of the marque with the liveries being the liveries from the past racing cars built by Porsche. The #92 carries the \"Pink Pig\" livery, homage to the Porsche 917/20 which used the same livery, and the #91 carries the iconic Rothmans-inspired livery from the 80s Porsche 956 and the Porsche 962.[72]\nRevealed at the 2016 Paris Motor Show the 2017 911 GT3 Cup is based on the 991.2 911 GT3. Improvements on the previous model include a larger 4.0-litre flat-six boxer engine delivering performance of 485\u00a0PS (357\u00a0kW; 478\u00a0bhp), improved aerodynamics and an enlarged escape-hatch in the roof. The GT3 Cup is priced at 189,900 Euro excluding taxes.[53]\nIn May 2018 Porsche revealed a new iteration of the 911 GT3 R based on the 991.2 GT3 RS, available for customer teams for the 2019 season. Its 4.0-litre flat-six boxer engine, largely identical to the unit used in the GT3 and GT3 RS street cars and GT3 Cup and RSR race cars, develops approx. 550\u00a0PS (405\u00a0kW; 542\u00a0bhp). Improvements include a larger diffuser for more efficient aero, double wishbone front suspension adopted from the RSR, a shim system allowing setup changes without new alignment, larger front tyres, an electro-hydraulically actuated clutch allowing the removal of the clutch pedal, a fuel cell that can be configured to be refilled from left or right of the vehicle depending on circuit layout, a rear-view camera and collision avoidance system, a fixed seat with movable pedal-box and energy-absorbing impact elements placed in the doors for improved safety as well as air conditioning. The GT3 R is priced at 459,000 Euro excluding taxes.[73][54]\nApart from numerous class wins, the 911 GT3 won major events overall:\nVarious national and regional Porsche Carrera Cup and Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge as well as the international Porsche Supercup one-make series - which serves as Formula One support series - utilise the 911 GT3 since 1998.\nDue to the absence of the official Porsche team in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, only privateers with the nearly obsolete air-cooled 993 GT2 Turbo were expected to represent the marque, with few chances to beat the Chrysler Viper for GTS class honors. Two new race versions of the water-cooled 996 GT3-R were entered in the GT class by private teams. The car entered by the German Manthey Racing team finished 13th overall.\nThe 996 GT3-R were made available to privateer teams. In the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring of the year 2000, a factory-backed effort of the local Phoenix team managed to beat the Zakspeed Chrysler Viper that dominated this race from 1998 to 2000. The improved 996 GT3-RS version of 2001 was entered in countless races in the years to follow, scoring not only many class wins, but also overall wins at Daytona and Spa in 2003. In 2004, the 996 GT3-RSR was made available, with numerous improvements to the RS, including a sequential gearbox, which allows for faster gearshifts.\nIn 2005, the new 997-generation racing vehicles began to debut with the GT3 Cup, followed by the launch of the 911 GT3-RSR at the 2006 Spa 24 Hours. In VLN endurance races, the Manthey entry won the last 4h race before the 24h event, and then the big event also. Their Porsche 997 GT3 RSR has a larger front splitter, taller rear wing and a 500\u00a0bhp 4.0L Flat-6 engine.\nAfter winning the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans outright, Porsche dominated the GT/N-GT class at Le Mans. There were no major competitors and Porsche took seven consecutive class wins from 1999 to 2005. In 2006 the Porsches led for much of the race but one by one the competitors had problems and withdrew. Last minute mechanical issues threw the Seikel car back behind the surprising winner Panoz Esperante.\n2007 saw the debut of the 997 GT3 RSR. IMSA Matmut took pole by more than a second over the Ferrari (but lost it after breaching Parc Ferm\u00e9 rules). The new Porsche was now fitted with wider rear tyres and smaller restrictors than the rules allow. This was compensated by the car weighing 100\u00a0kg more. The Porsche now stood at 1220\u00a0kg and 485\u00a0bhp. This was an advantage at Le Mans over the lighter and nimbler F430.\nFelbermayr-Proton and IMSA Performance Matmut received the new 997 just before the 2007 season. Marc Lieb and Richard Lietz share the better of the two Felbermayr cars. Patrick Pilet and Raymond Narac share the IMSA car. Felbermayr-Proton won the championship in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, Nicholas Armindo won the GTE-Am class.\n2003 Porsche 996 GT3 RS rear.\n2005 Porsche 996 GT3 RS front.\n2006 Porsche 996 GT3 Cup front.\nPorsche 996 GT3 Cup rear.\nPorsche 996 GT3 RSR front.\nPorsche 996 GT3 RSR rear.\nPorsche 996 GT3 RS GT300 front.\n2007 Porsche 997 GT3 RSR front.\n2010 Porsche 911 GT3 R Hybrid front.\n2011 Porsche 997 GT3 R front.\n2011 Porsche 997 GT3 RSR front.\n2013 Porsche 997 GT3 Cup front.\n2008 Porsche 997 GT3 Cup rear.\n2015 Porsche 911 GT3 RSR front.

This combination is possible because of a high-efficiency flat-4 petrol engine, low weight, and low drag. The Type 912 initially outsold the 911, boosting the manufacturer's total production until success of the 911 was assured.\nThe 912E was released for the 1976 model year for the U.S.-only market featuring an updated Porsche-designed VW 2.0 flat 4 with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection.\nConcerned that the considerable price increase of a Type 911 with flat opposed six-cylinder powerplant over the  Type 356 would cost the company sales and narrow brand appeal, in 1963 Porsche executives decided to introduce a new four-cylinder entry-level model.  Like the 911 (original internal factory designation \"901\"), the four-cylinder 912 was originally known at Zuffenhausen by a number with a zero in the middle, but the \"902\" designation was never used publicly.[3]  (\"912\" as project number was used after 1968 to indicate the 12 cylinder flat opposed engine developed for Porsche 917 racing car)\nIn 1963, Porsche assigned Dan Schwartz, later Chief Departmental Manager for Development, Mechanics, a project to oversee design and construction of a new horizontally-opposed four-cylinder engine for the 902, utilizing components from the new 901 six-cylinder engine, that would produce higher performance than their 356SC engine, and be less costly and complex than their Carrera 2 engine.   Another option explored by Claus von R\u00fccker was to increase displacement of the 356 Type 616 engine to 1.8 liters, add Kugelfischer fuel injection, and modify both valve and cooling systems.  Considering performance, cost, and scheduling, Porsche discontinued both of these design projects, and instead developed a third option, to tailor the 1.6 liter Type 616 engine to the 902.[4][5]\nBefore 911 production commenced in 1964, the Porsche Vehicle Research Department had set aside chassis numbers 13328, 13329, 13330, 13352, and 13386 through 13397 for research testing of the 902; research vehicle Serial Number 13394 is the oldest 902 known to exist today.  In production form, the Type 912 combined a 911 chassis / bodyshell with the 1.6L, four-cylinder, push-rod Type 616/36 engine, based upon the Type 616/16 engine used in the Type 356SC of 1964-1965.  With a lower compression ratio and new Solex carburetors, the Type 616/36 engine produced five less horsepower than the 616/16, but delivered about the same maximum torque at 3,500 rpm versus 4,200 rpm for the 616/16.  Compared to the 911, the resulting production Type 912 vehicle demonstrated superior weight distribution, handling, and range.  To bring 912 pricing close to the 356, Porsche also deleted some features standard on the 911.\nAs production of the 356 concluded in 1965, on April 5, 1965 Porsche officially began production of the 912 coup\u00e9.[6]   Styling, performance, quality construction, reliability, and price made the 912 a very attractive buy to both new and old customers, and it substantially outsold the 911 during the first few years of production.  Porsche produced nearly 30,000 912 coup\u00e9 units and about 2500 912 Targa body style units (Porsche's patented variation of a cabriolet) during a five-year manufacturing run.  Production of the Targa, complete with removable roof and heavy transparent plastic rear windows openable with a zipper (later called 'Version I' by Porsche and the 'soft-window Targa' by enthusiasts), commenced in December 1966 as a 1967 model.   In January 1968, Porsche also made available a Targa 'Version II' option ('hard window Targa') with fixed glass rear window, transforming the Targa into a coup\u00e9 with removable roof.[7]\nThe Type 912 was also made in a special version for the German autobahn police (polizei); the 100,000th Porsche car was a 912 Targa for the police of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the home state of Porsche.[8] In the April 1967 edition, the Porsche factory's Christophorus Magazine noted: \"On 21 December 1966, Porsche celebrated a particularly proud anniversary.  The 100,000th Porsche, a 912 Targa outfitted for the police, was delivered.\"\nPorsche executives decided that after the 1969 model year, continuation of 912 production would not be viable, due to both internal and external factors.   First, production facilities used for the 912 were reallocated to a new 914-6, a six-cylinder high performance version of the 914  Porsche-Volkswagen joint effort vehicle.   Second, the 911 platform had returned to Porsche's traditional three performance-level ladder, including a most powerful 911S, a fuel-injected 911E, and a base model 911T, with pricing largely in line with market expectations.  Third, more stringent United States engine emission control regulations also had a bearing on the decision; Ferry Porsche stated \"It would have taken some trouble to prepare the 912 for the new exhaust rules, and with the arrival of the 914 we would have had three different engines to keep current.  That was too many.\" [3]\nPorsche had constructed more than 32,000 of the Type 912 from April 1965 to July 1969. For the 1970 model year the four-cylinder 914 superseded the 912 as Porsche's entry-level model,  which Porsche had thought would be less expensive for them to manufacture and sell than the 912.  In practice, a deterioration in relationships between Porsche and Volkswagen - who had designed and planned to manufacture the 914 - severely curtailed the intended cost reduction, and 914 production was discontinued in early 1976.\nAfter a six-year absence, the 912 was re-introduced to North America for the 1976 model year as the 912E (internal factory designation 923) to fill the entry-level position left vacant by the discontinuation of the 914, while the new 924 \u2013 another Porsche-Volkswagen joint effort vehicle and the 914's official replacement \u2013 was being finalized and put into production.\nThe \"Prototyp\" Museum collection in Hamburg, Germany includes a 912E preseries vehicle constructed utilizing a 911 Chassis No. 911 520 1617 and four-cylinder VW-Porsche 90HP 2.0L Type 4 similar to the late-model 2.0L 914/4.[9]\nOnce in production, the 912E shared the \"G-Series\" bodywork with the 911S but was powered by an 86\u00a0bhp 2.0\u00a0L Volkswagen air-cooled engine, refined with a new Bosch L-Jetronic (Air Flow Controlled) fuel injection system.  During the production run of May 1975 to July 1976, Porsche manufactured nearly 2,100 of the 912E (E=Einspritzung), targeted to the [United States market.\nSold to the public for street use, the Porsche 912 has also proven successful as a race car, from production years to current vintage events.  In 1967 the 912 contributed to Porsche factory rally history when independent Polish driver Sobies\u0142aw Zasada drove a factory-loaned 912, bearing Polish plate 6177 KR, to capture the European Rally Championship for Group 1 series touring cars.[10]   In the 1967 Rally of Poland, the second oldest rally in the world and one of the oldest motorsport events in the world,[11] Zasada drove his 912 race No. 47 to finish first overall out of a starting field of 50 entries.[12]\nAs a vintage rally car, on January 29, 2012 Hayden Burvill, Alastair Caldwell, and their #35 1968 Porsche 912 finished first in class, and 7th overall in the 2012 London to Cape Town World Cup Rally; a 14 country, three continent, 14,000 kilometre, 26 driving-days event.[13]\n", "Porsche 914": "The Porsche 914 or VW-Porsche 914 is a mid-engined sports car designed,  manufactured and marketed collaboratively by Volkswagen and Porsche from 1969 to 1976.  It was available as a targa-topped two-seat roadster powered by either a flat-4 or flat-6 engine\nBy the late 1960s, both Volkswagen and Porsche were in need of new models; Porsche was looking for a replacement for their entry-level 912, and Volkswagen wanted a new range-topping sports coup\u00e9 to replace the Karmann Ghia coup\u00e9. At the time, the majority of Volkswagen's developmental work was handled by Porsche, part of a setup that dated back to Porsche's founding; Volkswagen needed to contract out one last project to Porsche to fulfill the contract, and decided to make the 914 that project. Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who was in charge of research and development at Porsche, was put in charge of the 914 project.\nOriginally intending to sell the vehicle with a flat four-cylinder engine as a Volkswagen and with a flat six-cylinder engine as a Porsche, Porsche decided during development that having Volkswagen and Porsche models sharing the same body would be risky for business in the American market, and convinced Volkswagen to allow them to sell both versions as Porsches in North America.\nOn March 1, 1968, the first 914 prototype was presented. However, development became complicated after the death of Volkswagen's chairman, Heinz Nordhoff, on April 12, 1968. His successor, Kurt Lotz, was not connected with the Porsche dynasty and the verbal agreement between Volkswagen and Porsche fell apart.\nIn Lotz's opinion, Volkswagen had all rights to the model, and no incentive to share it with Porsche if they would not share in tooling expenses. With this decision, the price and marketing concept for the 914 had failed before series production had begun. As a result, the price of the chassis went up considerably, and the 914/6 ended up costing only a bit less than the 911T, Porsche's next lowest priced car. The 914/6 sold quite poorly while the much less expensive 914/4 became Porsche's top seller during its model run, outselling the Porsche 911 by a wide margin with over 118,000 units sold worldwide.\nVolkswagen versions originally featured an 80\u00a0PS (59\u00a0kW; 79\u00a0bhp) fuel-injected 1.7 L flat-4 engine based on the Volkswagen air-cooled engine. Porsche's 914/6 variant featured a carbureted 110\u00a0PS (81\u00a0kW; 108\u00a0bhp) 2.0 L flat-6 engine from the 1969 911T, placed amidships in front of a version of the 1969 911's \"901\" gearbox configured for a mid-engined sports car. Karmann manufactured the rolling chassis at their plant, completing Volkswagen production in-house or delivering versions to Porsche for their final assembly.\nThe 914/6 models used lower gear ratios and high brake gearing in order to try to overcome the greater weight of the six-cylinder engine along with higher power output. Suspension, brakes, and handling were otherwise the same. A Volkswagen-Porsche joint venture, Volkswagen of America, handled export to the U.S., where both versions were badged and sold as Porsches. The four-cylinder cars were sold as Volkswagen-Porsches at European Volkswagen dealerships.\nSlow sales and rising costs prompted Porsche to discontinue the 914/6 variant in 1972 after producing 3,351 of them; its place in the lineup was filled by a variant powered by a new 100\u00a0PS (74\u00a0kW; 99\u00a0bhp) 2.0 L, fuel-injected version of Volkswagen's Type 4 engine in 1973. For 1974, the 1.7 L engine was replaced by a 85\u00a0PS (63\u00a0kW; 84\u00a0bhp) 1.8 L, and the new Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system was added to American units to help with emissions control. The 914's production ended in 1976. The 2.0 L flat-4 engine continued to be used in the 912E, introduced that year as an entry-level model until the front-engined I-4 cylinder 924 was introduced the following model year.\nThe 914 was Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year for 1970.[3]\nA 914/6 GT driven by Frenchmen Claude Ballot-Lena and Guy Chasseuil won the GTS class and finished sixth overall at the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans.[4]\nBrian Redman used a 914/6 to scout the course in practice runs for the 1970 Targa Florio.\nThe Porsche 914 was produced from 1969 to 1976 in the following models:\nTwo prototype 914s, dubbed 914/8, were built during 1969. The orange 914/8 was the first constructed, at the instigation of Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch (then head of the racing department), to prove the concept. Powered by the full-blown, {[convert|350|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} 908 [flat-8] racing engine, it was based on a surplus 914 handbuilt development prototype bodyshell (chassis No. 914111), hence the many differences from the standard vehicle (e.g., the quad headlights). The second, silver, road-registered car, powered by a carburetted and detuned 908 race engine making 300\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW; 300\u00a0PS) was then prepared as a gift to Ferry Porsche on his 60th birthday. Also based on a spare prototype shell (chassis No. 914006), it was much closer to the standard car in detail. By all accounts Ferry didn't like the car very much and it is now in the Porsche Museum. Neither car saw a racetrack except for the purposes of testing. The 914/8 was not considered for production as a regular model. Another factory prototype, a 914/6 (chassis no. 914114) surfaced in the US in 2001. Together with a surviving prototype Sportomatic 914/6 (chassis No. 914120), reputedly in Southern Germany, they are a special part of Porsche history.\nPlanned for the 1972 model year, the Porsche 916 program was cancelled after eleven prototypes with aerodynamic front and rear bumpers and either the 2.4 engine from the 911S, or the 2.7 from the Carrera. They were also to have a fixed steel roof, wider wheels, double grilled engine lid, and flared fenders as styled from the 914-6 GT cars.[5] Ventilated disc brakes were fitted to all four wheels, and also a \"mid-engined\" version of the then-new 915 transmission, giving a conventional shift pattern with one to four in an H and fifth out on a limb. One 916 was built to US specs and on delivery to the US was fitted with air conditioning by the dealer (Brumos) and has been housed at the Automobile Atlanta 914 museum since 1990 along with eleven other rare 914 and 914-6 models\nOver the seven model years, Porsche made a number of changes to the 914. Some of these changes were cosmetic and others were in response to changing crash protection standards. From 1970 to 1974, the 914 was offered with chrome or painted bumpers. In early 1970, rear bumpers were produced with a straight crease on either side of the license plate indent. Between 1970 and 1972, both front and rear bumpers were smooth without bumper guards. In 1973, bumper guards were added to the front of the car. In 1974, guards were also added to the rear bumper. In 1975 and 1976, the chrome or painted bumpers were replaced with heavy, rubber-covered units which actually made the cars more stable at high speeds.\nThe headlight surrounds were white from the first 914s to mid-production of 73 and subsequently black. Cars produced up to early 1972 had a fixed passenger seat and a removable passenger footrest. Later cars featured a movable passenger seat. Other interior differences included changing vinyl designs, gauge appearance, and air vent configurations in the dash.\nThe most significant performance upgrade during the vehicle's lifespan was the introduction of anti-roll bars, significantly improving the handling, and a change from the \"tail shifter\" to the \"side shifter\" gearbox for 1973, improving the otherwise vague long linkage.\nIn 1974, Porsche produced a series of Limited Edition cars for the North American market to commemorate Porsche's victories in the Can Am racing series, and were equipped with individual color schemes and came standard with otherwise optional equipment. The factory is said to have produced about 1,000 of these vehicles, about 50% Bumblebee and 50% Creamsicle. Variants of this series were manufactured and distributed in very limited numbers to European markets and Japan.\nThe Creamsicle: With a cream color exterior (paint code U2V9), these cars sported Phoenix red trim, including color matched lower valences, bumpers and Mahle wheels. This light ivory color scheme concept carried over from the 1973 911 Carrera RS series.\nThe Bumblebee: Featuring a black exterior (paint code L041), these cars sported a Sunflower yellow trim (paint code L13K). Black body paint color was always an additional cost special option on standard 914 Porsche cars, but was included as a standard component on the black 914 LE cars. All but one photo of the 914 Porsche Can Am prototype cars are Bumblebee cars. The black-based 914 LE color scheme is specific to the 914 LE cars and has no precedent with the Can Am race cars or the 1973 911 Carrera RS series cars. The majority of 914 Limited Editions seem to be Bumblebees.[6]\nAll 914 LE cars featured a specially designed front spoiler and negative side stripes. Additionally, all Limited Editions were equipped with front and rear anti sway bars, dual horns, leather covered steering wheel, driving lights, painted rear roll bar trim (as opposed to vinyl clad), and a center console with an oil temperature gauge, clock, and voltmeter.\nAccording to Internet Movie Cars Database, the 914 has made over 150 film and television appearances so far.[7]\nThese include the prominent car chase where the car is piloted by Deborah Grant in the UFO (TV series) episode The Psychobombs from 1971. On the television series The Rockford Files (1974-1980) Gretchen Corbett, played James Garner's attorney, and drove an orange Porsche 914 from 1974-1978.\nThe Porsche 914 is renowned for having been Formula One's first Safety Car following its deployment at the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix to help manage the race, which had seen various incidents due to treacherous weather conditions.[8]\n", "Porsche 914-6 GT": "The Porsche 914-6 GT was a race car built by Porsche, based on the 914 model with a 6-cylinder engine and GT package.\nThe 914-6 GT was a race configured version of the 914-6.  The factory offered the GT option, which was distinguishable by its box-like steel fender flares.  It quickly became known as the 914-6 GT and was raced employing different engine configurations. This included the 'T' specification, which was a basic 911 engine. Another popular configuration was to use a converted Carrera 6 engine.\nIn 1970, Porsche entered a 914-6 with the factory's GT option in the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The car, identified as #40, was driven by Claude Ballot-L\u00e9na and Guy Chasseuil.  It finished 6th overall, preceded only by prototype racecars like the V12 Ferrari 512S and Flat-12 Porsche 917K.  In addition, the #40 won its class ahead of several Porsche 911S entries.  914-6s also competed in some of the most important race competitions of its era, e.g. Targa Florio with Brian Redman, Monte Carlo Rally and Daytona International Speedway.  Walt Maas successfully campaigned a 914-6 \"GT\" in the IMSA race series.\nThe Porsche 914-6 was introduced in September 1969 and was a collaborative effort between Porsche and Volkswagen.  Short lived, only 3360 examples were produced between 1970 and 1972.  Sitting very low, the 914-6's suspension is a combination of a 911-type torsion bar front suspension with a rear coil spring suspension. It also features Porsche disc brakes.  The headlights hide in the hood and pop-up when needed. Its targa top can be stored in the rear trunk. The 914-6 received the ram-tuned Weber carbureted 2.0-litre flat six 110\u00a0hp Porsche engine that had been previously used with the basic 1969 911T.  Weighing just under 2100 pounds, The 914-6 proved to be considerably faster.  A five-speed manual gearbox was standard equipment on all models.\n", "Porsche 918 Spyder": "The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche.[3]  The Spyder is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.6-litre V8 engine, developing 608\u00a0PS (600\u00a0bhp; 447\u00a0kW), with two electric motors delivering an additional 283\u00a0PS (279\u00a0bhp; 208\u00a0kW) for a combined output of 887\u00a0PS (875\u00a0bhp; 652\u00a0kW). The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's five-cycle tests.[1]\nProduction began on September 18, 2013, with deliveries initially scheduled to begin in December 2013, and a starting price of ~ \u20ac611,000 (US$845,000 or GB\u00a3511,000).[4][5][6] The 918 Spyder was sold out in December 2014 and production ended in June 2015.[7]\nThe 918 Spyder was first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva Motor Show in March 2010.[4] On July 28, 2010, after 2,000 declarations of interest, the Supervisory Board of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart, approved series development of the 918 Spyder.[8] The production version was unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[9] Porsche also unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid, with styling from the 918 Spyder.[10]  The 918 Spyder was the second plug-in hybrid car from Porsche, after the 2014 Panamera S E-Hybrid.[11]\nThe 918 Spyder is powered by a 4,593\u00a0cc (4.6\u00a0L; 280.3\u00a0cu\u00a0in) naturally aspirated V8 engine built on the same architecture as the one used in the RS Spyder Le Mans Prototype racing car without any engine belts.\nThe engine weighs 135\u00a0kg according to Porsche and delivers 608\u00a0PS (600\u00a0hp; 447\u00a0kW) at 8,500 rpm and 528\u00a0N\u22c5m (389\u00a0lbf\u22c5ft) of maximum torque. This is supplemented by two electric motors delivering an additional 279\u00a0PS (275\u00a0hp; 205\u00a0kW). One 154\u00a0PS (113\u00a0kW; 152\u00a0hp) electric motor drives the rear wheels in parallel with the engine and also serves as the main generator. This motor and engine deliver power to the rear axle via a 7-speed gearbox coupled to Porsche's own PDK double-clutch system. The front 125\u00a0PS (123\u00a0hp; 92\u00a0kW) electric motor directly drives the front axle; an electric clutch decouples the motor when not in use. The total system delivers 887\u00a0PS (875\u00a0hp; 652\u00a0kW) and 1,280\u00a0N\u22c5m (944\u00a0lbf\u22c5ft) of torque. By October 2012, the engineering design was not finalized, but Porsche provided performance figures of 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0\u201362\u00a0mph) in 2.5 seconds, 0\u2013200\u00a0km/h (0\u2013124\u00a0mph) in 7.2 seconds, 0\u2013300\u00a0km/h (0\u2013186\u00a0mph) in 19.9 seconds and a tested top speed of 350\u00a0km/h (217\u00a0mph). The Porsche 918 Spyder has a power to weight ratio of 1.92\u00a0kg (4.23\u00a0lb) per horsepower, and the Weissach Package-equipped car has a power to weight ratio of 1.84\u00a0kg (4.06\u00a0lb) per horsepower.[6][12][13]\nIn Car and Driver's independent test of the Porsche 918, C/D achieved 0\u201360\u00a0mph (0\u201397\u00a0km/h) in 2.2 seconds, 0\u2013100\u00a0mph (0\u2013161\u00a0km/h) in 4.9 seconds, 0\u2013180\u00a0mph (0\u2013290\u00a0km/h) in 17.5 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 9.8 seconds.[14][15] Motor Trend's independent test of the Porsche 918 claims that with a 2.4 seconds 0-60\u00a0mph time it was the fastest car to 60\u00a0mph that they had ever tested. It stopped from 60-0\u00a0mph in 94 feet (97\u20130\u00a0km/h in 29\u00a0m), and broke Motor Trend's figure 8 record at 22.2 seconds.[16] European magazine tests yielded 7.0 seconds for 0\u2013200\u00a0km/h (0\u2013124\u00a0mph) and 17.75 seconds for the standing kilometer reaching 295.9\u00a0km/h (184\u00a0mph).[17][18]\nThe energy storage system is a 312-cell, liquid-cooled 6.8\u00a0kW\u00b7h lithium-ion battery positioned behind the passenger cell. In addition to a plug-in charge port at the passenger-side B-pillar, the batteries are also charged by regenerative braking and by excess output from the engine when the car is coasting. CO2 emissions are 79\u00a0g/km and fuel consumption is 3.0\u00a0L/100\u00a0km (94 imperial mpg/78 US mpg) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).[11][19] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under its five-cycle tests rated the 2015 model year Porsche 918 Spyder energy consumption in all-electric mode at 50 kWh per 100 miles, which translates into a combined city/highway fuel economy of 67 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (3.5 L/100\u00a0km; 80 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent). When powered only by the gasoline engine, EPA's official combined city/highway fuel economy is 22\u00a0mpg\u2011US (11\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 26\u00a0mpg\u2011imp).[1]\nThe 4.6 litre V8 petrol engine can recharge an empty battery on about two litres of fuel.[20]  The supplied Porsche Universal Charger requires seven hours to charge the battery on a typical 110 volt household AC socket or two hours on a dedicated Charging Dock installed with a 240 volt industrial supply. An optional DC Speed Charging Station can restore the battery to full capacity in 25 minutes.[21]\nThe 918 Spyder offers five different running modes: E-Drive allows the car to run under battery power alone, using the rear electric motor and front motor, giving a range of 18 miles (29\u00a0km) for the concept model.[21] The official U.S. EPA all-electric range is 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km). The total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery is 420 miles (680\u00a0km) according to EPA tests.[1] Under the E-Drive mode the car can reach 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[4] Two hybrid modes (Hybrid, and Race) use both the engine and electric motors to provide the desired levels of economy and performance. In Race mode a push-to-pass button initiates the Hot Lap setting, which delivers additional electrical power.[22]\nThe chassis is a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic monocoque and the brakes used are electromechanical brakes.[23]\nThe production version was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[9]  The 2014 model year 918 Spyder was produced in a limited series and it was developed in Weissach and assembled in Zuffenhausen. Porsche manufactured 918 units as a 2014 model year and production started on November 18, 2013, with deliveries scheduled to begin in December 2013.[4][5] Sales in the United States began in June 2014.[24] Pricing for the 918 Spyder started at US$845,000 (~ \u20ac611,000 or GB\u00a3511,000).[6] According to its battery size, the 918 Spyder was eligible to a federal tax credit of up to US$3,667.[25]\nAs of  November\u00a02014[update], over 800 units had been ordered worldwide, with planned production sold out through late March or early April 2015. Production ended in June 2015 as scheduled.[7]\nThe country with the most orders is the United States with 294 units, followed by China and Germany with approximately 100 orders each, and Canada ordering 35 units.[26][27][28]\nAccording to JATO Dynamics, a total of 105 units have been registered worldwide during the first nine months of 2014.[29] The United States is the leading market with 202 units delivered up to May 2015.[30] As of  October\u00a02014[update], a total of 9 units were registered in Switzerland, 6 in the Netherlands, 5 units in Canada, 4 in Sweden, 3 in Brazil and 1 in South Africa.[31][32][30][33]\nIn 2014 recalls were issued for five cars to replace rear-axle control arms and 39 cars to replace front lower control arms.\nAnother recall was made for some cars in 2015 to secure a wiring harness to prevent it from chafing.[34][35]\nAt the 2011 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Porsche unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 Spyder. Instead of using plug-in hybrid technology, power for the two electric motors is provided by a flywheel accumulator KERS system that sits beside the driver in the passenger compartment. The V8 is a further development of the direct injection engine from the RS Spyder race car developing 563 horsepower (420\u00a0kW). The electric motors each provide an additional 102 horsepower (76\u00a0kW), giving a peak power output of 767 horsepower (572\u00a0kW). The six speed gearbox is a development of the unit from the RS Spyder.[10]\nIn September 2013 a 918 fitted with the optional 'Weissach Package' set a N\u00fcrburgring lap time of 6:57 on the 20.6\u00a0km (12.8\u00a0mi) road course, reducing the previous record by 14 seconds, and making it the first series production street-legal car to break the 7-minute barrier.[24][36]\nThe 918 Spyder concept at the Porsche Museum\nRear view of the 918 Spyder Concept\nThe 918 Spyder concept badge\nThe 918 RSR concept at the Geneva Motor Show 2011\nThe 918 RSR concept at the Geneva Motor Show 2011\nThe 918 RSR centre console and flywheel\nThe 918 Spyder prototype (black) in Monaco\nA 918 Spyder in a PTS Viola Metallic colour\n918 Spyder Interior\n", "Porsche 924": "The Porsche 924 is a sports car produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1976 to 1988. A two-door, 2+2 coup\u00e9, the 924 was intended to replace the Porsche 914 as the company's entry-level model.\nAlthough the water-cooled, front-engined 928 gran turismo was designed first, the 924 was the first road-going Porsche to have a front engine rear wheel drive configuration. It was also the first Porsche to be offered with a fully automatic transmission.\nThe 924 made its public debut in November 1975. It was criticised by enthusiasts for its mediocre performance, but a sales success with just over 150,000 produced during a 1977-1988 production run, and an important profits generator for the company. The closely related 944 introduced in the U.S. market in 1983 was meant to replace the 924, but 924 production continued through 1985, followed by a 944-engined 924S through 1988.\nThe 924 was originally a joint project of Volkswagen and Porsche created by the Vertriebsgesellschaft (VG), the joint sales and marketing company funded by Porsche and VW to market and sell sports cars (Ludvigsen: Porsche, Excellence was Expected). For Volkswagen, it was intended to be that company's flagship coup\u00e9 sports car and was dubbed \"Project 425\" during its development. For Porsche, it was to be its entry-level sports car replacing the 914. At the time, Volkswagen lacked a significant internal research and design division for developing sports cars; further, Porsche had been doing the bulk of the company's development work anyway, per a deal that went back to the 1940s. In keeping with this history, Porsche was contracted to develop a new sporting vehicle with the caveat that this vehicle must work with an existing VW/Audi inline-four engine. Porsche chose a rear-wheel drive layout and a rear-mounted transaxle for the design to help provide 48/52 front/rear weight distribution; this slight rear weight bias aided both traction and brake balance.\nThe 1973 oil crisis, a series of automobile-related regulatory changes enacted during the 1970s and a change of directors at Volkswagen made the case for a Volkswagen sports car less striking and the 425 project was put on hold. After serious deliberation at VW, the project was scrapped entirely after a decision was made to move forward with the cheaper, more practical, Golf-based Scirocco model instead. Porsche, which needed a model to replace the 914, made a deal with Volkswagen leadership to buy the design back. The 914 was discontinued before the 924 entered production, which resulted in the reintroduction of the Porsche 912 to the North American market as the 912E for one year to fill the gap.\nThe deal specified that the car would be built at the ex-NSU factory in Neckarsulm located north of the Porsche headquarters in Stuttgart, Volkswagen becoming the subcontractor. Hence, Volkswagen employees would do the actual production line work (supervised by Porsche's own production specialists) and that Porsche would own the design. It made its debut at a November 1975 press launch at the harbour at La Grande Motte, Camargue in the south of France rather than a motor show.  The relative cheapness of building the car made it both profitable and fairly easy for Porsche to finance. While criticised for its performance, it nevertheless became one of Porsche's best-selling models.\nThe original design used an Audi-sourced four-speed manual transmission from a front wheel drive car but now placed and used as a rear transaxle. It was mated to VW's EA831 2.0\u00a0L I4 engine, variants of which were used in the Audi 100 and the Volkswagen LT van (common belief is that 'the engine originated in the LT van', but it first appeared in the Audi car and in 924 form has a Porsche-designed cylinder head). The Audi engine, equipped with a Weber/Holley carburetor, was also used in the 1977-1979 AMC Gremlin, Concord, and Spirit. The 924 engine used Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection, producing 95 horsepower (71\u00a0kW) in North American trim. This was brought up to 110 horsepower (82\u00a0kW) in mid-1977 with the introduction of a catalytic converter, which reduced the need for power-robbing smog equipment. The four-speed manual was the only transmission available for the initial 1976 model, later this was replaced by a five-speed dog-leg unit. An Audi three-speed automatic was offered starting with the 1977.5 model. In 1980, the five-speed transmission was changed to a conventional H-pattern, with reverse now on the right beneath fifth gear.[1]\nIn 1980, the model received some minor changes including a three-way catalyst and slightly higher compression, which brought power up to 115\u00a0hp (86\u00a0kW).[1] Nonetheless, the strong Deutschemark and US inflation severely hampered sales, as a well equipped 924 now easily could cost twice as much as the considerably more powerful Nissan 280ZX.[2]\nEuropean models, which did not require any emissions equipment, made 125\u00a0hp (93\u00a0kW). They also differed visually from the US spec model by not having the US cars' low-speed impact bumpers and the round reflectors plus side-marker lamps on each end of the body.\nThe 924 was sold in Japan at Yanase dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles, with right hand drive for its entire generation. Sales were helped by the fact that it was in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations with regards to its engine displacement and exterior dimensions.\nA five-speed transmission, available in normally aspirated cars (type 016) starting in 1979 and standard on all turbos (type G31), was a dog-leg shift pattern Porsche unit, with first gear below reverse on the left side. This was robust, but expensive due to some 915 internal parts, and was replaced for 1980 with a normal H-pattern Audi five-speed on all non-turbo cars. This lighter duty design was originally not used on the more powerful 924 Turbo.[3] The brakes were solid discs at the front and drums at the rear. The car was criticized in Car and Driver magazine for this braking arrangement, which was viewed as a step backward from the 914's standard four-wheel disc brakes. However, four-wheel disc brakes, five stud hubs and alloys from the 924 Turbo were available on the base 924 as an \"S\" package starting with the 1980 model year. Also, standard brakes could be optioned on the turbo as a cost-saving measure.\nThe overall styling was created by Dutchman Harm Lagaay, a member of the Porsche styling team, with the folding headlights, sloping bonnet line and grille-less nose giving the car its popular wedge shape. The car went on sale in the US in July 1976 as a 1977 model with a base price of $9,395. Porsche made small improvements to the 924 each model year between 1977 and 1985, but nothing major was changed on non-turbo cars. Turbo charged variants received many different, non-VW sourced parts, throughout the drive train, and when optioned with the M471 disc brake package and forged 16\" wheels, the car was twice as expensive as a standard model. Its appearance has been credited as the inspiration for the second generation Mazda RX-7.\nJ. Pasha, writing in Excellence magazine, at the time, described the 924 as \"the best handling Porsche in stock form\".\nWhile the car was praised for its styling, handling, fuel economy, and reliability, it was harshly written up in the automotive press for its very poor performance, especially with the US spec cars. With only 95-110\u00a0hp, rapid acceleration was simply not an option, but the Porsche name carried with it higher expectations. When the 924 Turbo models came out, Car and Driver magazine proclaimed the car \"Fast...at Last!\"  The later 924S had performance on par with the Turbo, but with much improved reliability, and at less cost.  The '81 and '82 Turbos and the associated special variants are garnering interest in collector circles; and while many still exist, excellent examples of the cars are quite scarce as of today.\n* includes 3000 special edition \"Martini\" cars\n\u2020 includes 1002 special edition \"Le Mans\" cars\n[4][5][6]\n\u2021 includes 1015 special edition \"50 Jahre Porsche/Weissach\" cars.[7]\n* sum total of cars brought into US and Japan\n\u2020 For year 1979 Porsche 924 Turbo. Few of them were made and due to the age of the vehicle they became very rare. In 2009 there were less than 10 right hand drive 1979 Porsche 924 Turbo S1s reported worldwide.\n^ cars brought only into Italy\nThere was also a sport package for the 924S, available for the ROW and US market for which production data is stated below.\nPorsche executives soon recognized the need for a higher-performance version of the 924 that could bridge the gap between the basic 924s and the 911s. Having already found the benefits of turbochargers on several race cars and the 1975 911 Turbo, Porsche chose to use this technology for the 924, eventually introducing the 924 Turbo as a 1978 model.\nPorsche started with the same Audi-sourced VW EA831 2.0\u00a0L I4, designed an all new cylinder head (which was hand assembled at Stuttgart), dropped the compression to 7.5:1 and engineered a KKK K-26 turbocharger for it. With 10\u00a0psi (69\u00a0kPa) boost, output increased to 170 horsepower (130\u00a0kW). The 924 Turbo's engine assembly weighed about 65\u00a0lb (29\u00a0kg) more, so front spring rates and anti-roll bars were revised. Weight distribution was now 49/51 compared to the original 924 figure of 48/52 front to rear.\nIn order to help make the car more functional, as well as to distinguish it from the naturally aspirated version, Porsche added an NACA duct in the hood and air intakes in the badge panel in the nose, 15-inch spoke-style alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes with five-stud hubs and a five-speed transmission. Forged 16-inch flat wheels of the style used on the 928 were optional, but fitment specification was that of the 911 which the 924 shared wheel offsets with. Internally, Porsche called it the \"931\" (left hand drive) and \"932\" (right hand drive), much like the 911 Carrera Turbo, which had been \"Type 930\". These designations are commonly used by 924 aficionados.\nThe turbocharged VW EA831 engine allowed the 924's performance to come surprisingly close to that of the 911 SC (180\u00a0bhp), thanks in part to a lighter curb weight, but it also brought reliability problems.[citation needed] This was in part due to the fact that the general public did not know how to operate, or care for, what is by today's standards a primitive turbo setup.[opinion]\nA turbocharger cooled only by engine oil led to short component life and turbo-related seal and seat problems. To fix the problems, Porsche released a revised 924 Turbo Series 2 (although badging still read \"924 turbo\") in 1979. By using a smaller turbocharger running at increased boost, slightly higher compression of 8:1 and an improved fuel injection system with DITC ignition triggered by the flywheel, reliability improved and power rose to 177 horsepower (132\u00a0kW; 179\u00a0PS).\nIn North America, the 924 Turbo arrived in late 1979 for the 1980 model year. It was saddled with extra weight, due to the federally mandated large bumpers and other safety equipment, and less power due to stringent emissions controls. Power was 143\u00a0hp (107\u00a0kW), nearly twenty percent down on the European model. For the 1981 model year, power increased slightly to 149\u00a0hp (111\u00a0kW) and the transmission was switched to one with a regular H-pattern layout.[8]\nAfter a successful sales run of both naturally aspirated and turbo models in 1980, Porsche unexpectedly released the 924 Carrera GT, making clear their intention to enter the 924 in competition. By adding an intercooler, increasing compression to 8.5:1 as well as various other little changes, Porsche was able to develop the 924 Turbo into the race car they had wanted, dubbing it the \"924 Carrera GT\".\nVisually it differed to the 931 in that it had polyurethane plastic front and rear flared guards, a polyurethane plastic front spoiler, a top mounted air scoop for the intercooler, a much larger rubber rear spoiler and a flush mounted front windscreen. It lost the 931's NACA duct in the hood but retained the air intakes in the badge panel. This more aggressive styling was later used for as motivation for the 944.\nIn order to comply with the homologation regulations, the 924 Carrera GT and later 924 Carrera GTS were offered as road cars as well, producing 210 and 245\u00a0hp (157 and 183\u00a0kW) respectively. Clubsport versions of the GTS were also available with 280\u00a0hp (209\u00a0kW; 284\u00a0PS), and factory included Matter rollcage and race seats. 924 Carrera GT variations were known by model numbers 937 (left hand drive) and 938 (right hand drive).\nThe ultimate development of the 924 in its race trim was the 924 Carrera GTR race car, which produced 375 horsepower (280\u00a0kW; 380\u00a0PS) from a highly modified version of the 2.0\u00a0L I4 used in all 924s. In 1980, Porsche entered three 924 GTRs at the 24hrs of Le Mans, which went on to finish 6th, 12th and 13th overall. Also building a 924GTR rally race car, and two other GTRs (Miller and BF Goodrich).\nLastly, in 1981, Porsche entered one of two specially built 924 Carrera GTPs (the \"944GTP Le Mans\") in which Porsche Motorsports introduced a new prototype highly modified 2.5 liter I4 engine. This engine sported four valves per cylinder, dual over head camshafts, twin balance shafts and a single turbocharger K28 to produce 420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS). This last variant managed a seventh place overall finish and spent the least time out of any other car in the pits. This new 2.5 liter configuration engine is the predecessor of the 944 platforms and the later 1987-88 944S 16V M44/40 power-plant.\nProduction of the 924 Turbo ceased in 1982 except for the Italian market which lasted until 1984. This was due to the restrictions on engines larger than two liters, putting the forthcoming 2.5 liter 944 into a much higher tax category.\nIn 1984, VW decided to stop manufacturing the engine blocks used in the 2.0 924, leaving Porsche with a predicament. The 924 was considerably cheaper than its 944 stablemate, and dropping the model left Porsche without an affordable entry-level option. The decision was made to equip the narrower bodied 924 with a slightly detuned version of the 944's 163\u00a0bhp 2.5 litre straight four, upgrading the suspension but retaining the 924's early interior. The result was 1986's 150\u00a0bhp 924S. Porsche also decided to re-introduce the 924 to the American market with an initial price tag of under $20,000.\nIn 1988, the 924S' final year of production, power increased to 160\u00a0PS (118\u00a0kW; 158\u00a0bhp) matching that of the previous year's Le Mans spec cars and the base model 944 (itself detuned by 3\u00a0PS (2\u00a0kW; 3\u00a0bhp) for 1988). This was achieved using different pistons which raised the S' compression ratio from 9.7:1 to 10.2:1, the knock-on effect being an increase in the octane rating, up from 91 RON to 95. This made the 924S slightly faster than the base 944 due to its lighter weight and more aerodynamic body.\nWith unfavourable exchange rates in the late 1980s, Porsche decided to focus its efforts on its more upmarket models, dropping the 924S for 1989 and the base 944 later that same year.\nThe 1988 924S SE (US) and \"Le Mans\" (ROW) were Club Sport editions aimed at autocross (US term for autotests to UK readers) and club racers. \nThe final 924S RHD 'run-out' versions in 1988 for the UK (just 37 white and 37 black vehicles) had \"Le Mans\" logos with stripes on their flanks. Officially known at Porsche as the \"Sportliches Sondermodell\" (loosely translates as Sporting Special Model) their options package list M-755 was more complete than the Special Edition M-756 for the US.\nOnly 980 Club Sport option cars were built in total.\n500 units M-756 for US black only, \n250 GER 200 black and 50 white cars, \n230 ROW 113 black and 117 white; totalling 480 units M-755.\nROW \"Le Mans\" Edition M-755:\nOnly on the final 74, GB supplied, RHD cars were the exterior side stripes broken by scripted \u2018Le Mans\u2019 logos on the lower part of the door, while the rims of the holes in each wheel were either in the Ochre (white cars) or Turquoise (black cars). Inside, all the cars featured cloth-upholstered \"Turbo\" sports seats, with the cloth door panels also colour-coded. They had the 360\u00a0mm (14\u00a0in) steering wheel and all the 74 British M-755 cars came with a 160 BHP engine plus an electric tilt/removable sunroof fitted as standard. They were lowered 10\u00a0mm (0.39\u00a0in) at the front and 15\u00a0mm (0.59\u00a0in) at the rear, and fitted with stiffer springs and gas-filled shock absorbers all round. They also had 'Sport' anti-roll bars with diameters of 21.5\u00a0mm (0.85\u00a0in) at the front but 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in), (rather than 14\u00a0mm (0.55\u00a0in)), at the rear. Wheels were \u2018telephone dial\u2019 cast alloy 6J x 15s at the front and 7J x 15s (at the rear).\nROW M-755 Paint finishes and interiors were also only offered in two colour choices - Alpine White with Ochre/Grey detailing and upholstery - or Black with Turquoise detailing and grey/turquoise upholstery.  \nOn ROW cars there was no Le Mans logo, nor striping and the phone dial wheels in white or black matching color had outer rims of respectively ochre or turquoise. ROW Upholstery was the grey/ochre striped flannel cloth with ochre piping for Alpine White cars, or grey/turquoise flannel with turquoise piping for Black cars.\nUS market SE:\nBlack only paint scheme with optional SE Edition decal. Equipped with manual steering, manual windows and door locks, sunroof delete, radio delete, AC delete, cruise delete, passenger side door mirror delete, wider 15x7 phone dial alloys for the rear while retaining 15x6 in front, and the M030 package which included stiffer springs and Koni shocks. The cars had a unique lightweight gray knit cloth upholstery (which deteriorated very quickly) with maroon pinstriping, and maroon carpeting. The sunroof, A/C, cruise, power steering, passenger door mirror, and radio could be added back optionally.\nThe 924 has its own racing series in the UK run by the BRSCC and Porsche Racing Drivers Association. The Porsche 924 Championship was started in 1992 by Jeff May who was championship coordinator until his death on 10 November 2003. Jeff May was also one of the founding members of Porsche Club Great Britain.\nIn the United States, the 924S is also eligible to race in the 944-Spec racing class.\n\n", "Porsche 928": "The Porsche 928 is a luxury grand tourer produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1978 to 1995. Originally intended to replace the company's iconic 911, the 928 combined the power, poise, and handling of a sports car with the refinement, comfort, and equipment of a luxury sedan. Porsche executives believed such a flagship would have wider appeal than the compact, quirky and sometimes difficult 911.\nThe 928 has the distinction of being the company's first production V8 powered model and only coup\u00e9 powered by a front-mounted V8 engine.\nBy the late 1960s Porsche had firmly established itself as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars.  Executives, including owner Ferdinand Porsche, were beginning to consider adding a luxury touring car to the line-up. Managing director Ernst Fuhrmann was pressuring Ferdinand to approve development of the new model due to concerns that the then-current flagship model, the 911, was reaching the limits of its potential. Slumping sales of the 911 seemed to confirm that the model was approaching the end of its economic life cycle. Fuhrmann envisioned the new range-topping gran turismo model as being the best possible combination of a sports coup\u00e9 and a luxury sedan. This would set it apart from the 911, had a relatively spartan interior and true sports car performance.\nOrdered by Ferdinand Porsche to design a production-feasible concept for the new model, Fuhrmann initiated a design study in 1971, eventually yielding the 928. Several drivetrain layouts were considered during early development, including rear and mid-engined designs, but most were dismissed because of technical and legislative difficulties. Having the engine, transmission, catalytic converter(s) and exhaust all cramped into a small rear engine bay made emission and noise control difficult, problems Porsche had with the 911. After deciding that the mid-engine layout did not allow enough room in the passenger compartment, a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout was chosen. Porsche may have feared that the U.S. government would soon ban the sale of rear-engined cars in response to concern over safety problems with the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair.\nPorsche engineers wanted a large-displacement engine to power the 928, and prototype units were built with a 5-litre V8 producing nearly 300\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW). Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch wanted this car to use a 4.6-litre V10 with 88\u00a0mm bore spacing based upon Audi's five-cylinder engine.  The five-cylinder unit is a derivative of the Volkswagen Golf EA827 engine, essentially an inline-four with another cylinder added. Several members of the Porsche board objected, chiefly because they wanted Porsche AG to maintain some separation from Volkswagen.\nThe resulting M28 engine has multiple unusual features. Its bore spacing is 122\u00a0mm, almost exactly the same size as a Chrysler 426 hemi or a big block Chevrolet engine. This engine uses thick aluminum cylinder barrels, hence the lower displacement. The engine was designed for air flow first, thus the spark plugs are located at the top of the head. The four-bolt bearings are sizeable, and are fed oil via grooves in the bottom surface of the block. The oil and water pumps are driven by the timing belt, and the design of the engine allows for sufficient air flow with a low hood.\nThe first two running prototypes of Porsche's M28 V8 used one four-barrel carburetor for initial testing. The cars were sold with the planned Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system. When increasing concern within the company over price and availability of fuel during the oil crisis of the 1970s became an issue of contention, smaller engines were considered in the interest of fuel economy. A push began for the development of a 3.3 L 180\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW) powerplant they had designs for, but company engineers balked at this suggestion. Both sides finally settled on a 4.5 L, SOHC per bank 16-valve V8 producing 240\u00a0PS (180\u00a0kW; 240\u00a0hp) (219\u00a0hp (163\u00a0kW) in North America), which they considered to have an acceptable compromise of performance and fuel economy.\nThe finished car debuted at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show before going on sale later that year as a 1978 model. Although it won early acclaim for its comfort and power, sales were slow. Base prices were much higher than that of the previous range-topping 911 model and the 928's front-engined, water-cooled design alienated many Porsche purists.\nFuhrmann's replacement, Peter Schutz, decided that the models should be sold side by side, feeling that the 911 still had potential in the company's line-up. Legislation against rear-engined vehicles did not materialize. Although it never sold in the numbers Fuhrmann envisioned, the 928 developed an avid following and had an 18 year production run.\nThe 928 featured a large, front-mounted and water-cooled V8 engine driving the rear wheels. Originally displacing 4.5 L and featuring a single overhead camshaft design, it produced 219 hp (163\u00a0kW/222 PS) for the North American market and 237\u00a0hp (176\u00a0kW/240 PS) in other markets. Porsche upgraded the engine from mechanical to electronic fuel injection in 1980 for US models, although power remained the same. This design marked a major change in direction for Porsche (started with the introduction of the Porsche 924 in 1976), whose cars had until then used only rear- or mid-mounted air-cooled flat engines with four or six cylinders.\nPorsche utilized a transaxle in the 928 to help achieve 50/50 front/rear weight distribution, aiding the car's balance. Although it weighed more than the difficult-to-handle 911, its more neutral weight balance and higher power output gave it similar performance on the track. The 928 was regarded as the more relaxing car to drive at the time. It came with either a five-speed dog leg manual transmission, or a Mercedes-Benz-derived automatic transmission, originally with three speeds, with four-speed from 1983 in North America and 1984 in other markets. More than 80% had the automatic transmission. Exact percentage of manual gearbox cars for entire production run is not known but it is believed to be between 15 and 20%.\nThe body, styled by Wolfgang M\u00f6bius under guidance of Anatole Lapine, was mainly galvanized steel, but the doors, front fenders,  and hood were aluminum in order to make the car more lightweight. It had a substantial luggage area accessed via a large hatchback. The new polyurethane elastic bumpers were integrated into the nose and tail and covered in body-coloured plastic; an unusual feature for the time that aided the car visually and reduced its drag. Porsche opted not to offer a convertible variant but several aftermarket modifiers offered convertible conversions, most notably Carelli, based in Orange County, CA. The Carelli conversions were sold as complete cars, with the conversion doubling the price of the car. A reported 12 units were made.\nThe 928 qualified as a 2+2, having two small seats in the rear. Both rear seats could be folded down to enlarge the luggage area, and both the front and rear seats had sun visors for occupants. The rear seats are small (due to the prominent transmission hump) and have very little leg room; they are only suitable for adults on very short trips or children.  The 928 was also the first vehicle in which the instrument cluster moved along with the adjustable steering wheel in order to maintain maximum instrument visibility.\nThe 928 included several other innovations such as the \"Weissach Axle\", a simple rear-wheel steering system that provides passive rear-wheel steering to increase stability while braking during a turn, and an unsleeved, silicon alloy engine block made of aluminum, which reduced weight and provided a highly durable cylinder bore.\nPorsche's design and development efforts paid off during the 1978 European Car of the Year,[1] where the 928 won ahead of the BMW 7 Series, and the Ford Granada. The 928 is the only sports car so far to have won this competition, where the usual winners are mainstream hatchbacks and sedans/saloons from major European manufacturers. This is regarded as proof of how advanced the 928 was, compared to its contemporaries.\nStyling was the same in both 1978 and 1979, with the body lacking both front and rear spoilers. From 1980 (1983 in North America) through 1986, front and rear spoilers were present on \"S\" models, rear spoilers being integrated into the hatch. From 1987 through 1995, the front spoiler is integrated into the nose and the rear spoiler became a separated wing rather than an integrated piece, and side skirts were added. The rear tail-light configuration was also different from previous versions. GTS models had wider rear fenders added to give more room for 9\" wide wheels. Another easily noticeable visual difference between versions is the style of the wheels. Early 928s had 15\" or 16\" \"phone dial\"-style wheels, while most 1980s 928s had 16\" slotted \"flat discs\", CSs, SEs and 1989 GTs had 16\" \"Club Sport\" wheels, later GTs had 16\" \"Design 90\" style wheels which were also option on same period S4s, the GTS used two variations of the 17\" \"CUP\" wheels.\nPorsche introduced a refreshed 928 S into the European market in 1980 model year, although it was summer of 1982 and MY 1983 before the model reached North America. Externally, the S wore new front and rear spoilers and sported wider wheels and tires than the older variant, but the main change for the 928 S was under the hood, where a revised 4.7 L engine was used. European versions debuted with 300 PS (221\u00a0kW/297\u00a0hp), and were upgraded to 310 PS (228\u00a0kW/306\u00a0hp) for 1984 model year, though it is rumored [and proven on chassis dynamometers] that they typically made around 330\u00a0hp.[citation needed] From 1984 to 1986, the S model was called S2 in UK. These cars used Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection and purely electronic Bosch ignition, the same systems used on the later 32-valve cars, though without the pollution controls.  North American-spec 1983 and 1984 S models used, among other differences, smaller valves, milder camshafts, smaller diameter intake manifolds, and additional pollution equipment in order to meet emissions regulations, and were limited to 234\u00a0hp (174\u00a0kW/230 PS) as a result. Due to low grade fuel 16V low compression S engine was made for Australian market in 1985 model year. It had 9.3:1 compression ratio pistons instead of normal 10.4:1 but used same large intake, high lift cams, large valves etc. of other S engines.\nAs the faster European model was not available in the United States and Canada during the first three years of its existence, a \"Competition Group\" option was created to allow North American customers to have an S model lookalike with spoilers, 16\" flat disc wheels, sport seats, sport springs and Bilstein shocks. Customers could specify paint and interior colors the same way as on a normal 928. Two cars were made in late 1980 model year for U.S. with this option. The package was officially available in 1981 and 1982 model years and was canceled in 1983 when the S model became available for these markets. Many cars have had S model features added by subsequent owners, making original \"Competition Group\" cars difficult to distinguish without checking option codes.\nIn 1982 model year, two special models were available for different markets. 202 \"Weissach Edition\" cars were sold in North America. Unusual features were champagne gold metallic paint, matching brushed gold flat disc wheels, two-tone leather interior, a plaque containing the production number on the dash and the extremely collectible three-piece Porsche luggage set. It's believed these cars were not made with S spoilers even though these were available in U.S. during this time period as part of the \"Competition Group\" option. The \"Weissach Edition\" option was also available for the US market 911 in 1980 model year and 924 in 1981 model year.\n141 special \"50th Jubilee\" 928 S models were available outside the U.S. and Canada to celebrate the company's 50-year existence as a car manufacturer. This model is also sometimes referred to as the \"Ferry Porsche Edition\" because his signature was embroidered into the front seats. It was painted meteor metallic and fitted with flat disc wheels, wine red leather and special striped fabric seat centers. Similar 911 and 924 specials were also made for world markets.\nPorsche updated the North American 928 S for 1985, replacing the 4.7 L SOHC engine with a new 5.0 L DOHC unit sporting four valves per cylinder and producing 288\u00a0hp (215\u00a0kW/292 PS). Seats were also updated to a new style, these cars are sometimes unofficially called S3 to distinguish them from 16-valve \"S\" models. European models kept a 4.7 L engine, which was somewhat more powerful as standard, though lower 9.3:1 compression 32-valve engine together with catalytic converters became an option in some European countries and Australia for 1986. In 1986, revised suspension settings, larger brakes with 4-piston calipers and modified exhaust was installed on the 928S, marking the final changes to old body style cars.  These were straight from the 928S4, which was slated to debut a few months later. These changes came starting from VIN 1001, which means that the first thousand '86's had the old brakes, but later cars had the later systems. This later 1986 model is sometimes referred to as a 1986\u200b1\u20442 or 1986.5 because of these changes. The name is a little misleading as more than 3/4 of the 1986 production had these updates.\nThe 928 S4 variant debuted in the second half of 1986 as a 1987 model, an updated version of the 5.0 L V8 for all markets producing 320 PS (235\u00a0kW/316\u00a0hp), sporting a new single-disc clutch in manual gearbox cars, larger torque converter in automatics and fairly significant styling updates which gave the car a cleaner, sleeker look. S4 was much closer to being a truly world car than previous models as only major differences for North American models were instrumentation in either kilometers or miles, lighting, front and rear bumper shocks and the availability of catalytic converters in many other markets. The Australian market version was only one with different horsepower rating at 300 PS (221\u00a0kW/296\u00a0hp) due to preparation for possible low grade fuel. Even this was achieved without engine changes.\nA Club Sport variant which was up to 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb) lighter became available to continental Europe and U.S. in 1988. This model was watered down version of the 1987 factory prototype which had a lightened body. Also in 1987 the factory made four white lightened manual gearbox S4 models for racecar drivers who were on their payroll at the time. These were close to same as later actual Club Sport models and can also be considered prototypes for it. An SE (sometimes called the S4 Sport due to model designation on rear bumper), a sort of halfway point between a normally equipped S4 and the more race-oriented Club Sport, became available to the UK. It's generally believed these Porsche Motorsport-engined cars have more hp than the S4. They utilize parts which later became known as GT pistons, cams and engine ECU programs. Some of them had stronger, short geared manual gearbox. The automatic gearbox was not available.\nFor the 1989 model year, a visible change inside was digital trip computer in dashboard. At the same time Australian models received the same 320 PS (235\u00a0kW/316\u00a0hp) engine management setup as other markets. Porsche debuted the 928 GT in the late winter 1988/89 after dropping the slowly selling CS and SE. In terms of equipment, the GT was like the 928 SE, having more equipment than a Club Sport model but less than a 928 S4 to keep the weight down somewhat. It had the ZF 40% limited-slip differential as standard like the Club Sport and SE before it. Also like the CS and SE, the GT was only available with a manual gearbox. European 1989 CS and GT wheels had an RDK tire pressure monitoring system as standard, which was also optional for the same year S4. For 1990 model year Porsche made RDK and a 0-100% variable ratio limited-slip called PSD (Porsche SperrDifferential) standard in both GT and S4 models for all markets. This system is much like the one from the 959 and gives the vehicle even more grip. In 1990 the S4 was no longer available with a manual gearbox.\nThe S4 and GT variants were both cut at the end of 1991 model year, making way for the final version of the 928. The 928 GTS came for sale in late 1991 as a 1992 model in Europe and in spring of 1992 as an early 1993 model in North America. Changed bodywork, larger front brakes and a new, more powerful 5.4 L, 350 PS (257\u00a0kW/345\u00a0hp) engine were the big advertised changes; what Porsche wasn't advertising was the price. Loaded GTS models could eclipse US$100,000 in 1995, making them among the most expensive cars on the road at the time. This severely hampered sales despite the model's high competency and long standard equipment list. Porsche discontinued the GTS model that year after shipping only 77 of them to the United States. Total worldwide production for all years was a little over 61,000 cars.\nSecond-hand models' value decreased as a result of high maintenance costs due to spare parts that are expensive to manufacture. Many parts suppliers and enthusiast networks exist, especially in the United States, Germany and UK.\nAs of 2016, values are trending upwards.[2]\nWith the release of the Cayenne SUV, Porsche has met with renewed success with a front-engined, V8-powered model. The company's 2005 announcement that a new V8-powered 4-door grand tourer model called Panamera would be launched in 2009 fueled rumors and fan speculation of a reborn 928. Although the Panamera will be a 4-door model, Road and Track magazine published a speculative piece in their April 2006 issue regarding the possibility of a new, 928-esque coup\u00e9 that may debut on a shortened version of the Panamera's platform sometime around 2011 or 2012 model year. As of January 2017, no announcement has been made by Porsche that could add credibility to this speculation.\nThe evolution of the 928 during its 18 years of production was quite subtle. The tables below show the major differences, which were made to the nose, tail, interior, engine, and wheels.\n1978\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\nAll production numbers are approximates collected from several sources.

Its also known by name 928-4, 928S.[9] It featured 10\u00a0in (254\u00a0mm) longer wheelbase than normal 928 production model, including an extended roof above the rear seats to better accommodate tall passengers, at the time very advanced projector headlights, the 5 liter 32-valve engine before it was introduced in US market, and S4 front and rear bumpers two years before they entered production.\nThree years later, in 1987, the lengthened 928 that had been presented to the company's founder on his 75th birthday turned up as a \"Feasibility Study\", now with a second (rather narrow) set of doors, apparently opening in the same way as the suicide doors seen on the later Mazda RX-8.[10]  At the time \"Study H50\" appeared to sink with little trace, but two decades later, with the launch of the larger four-door Porsche Panamera saloon, the 928 based four-door saloon prototype from 1987 acquired greater significance.[10]\nIn 1986 Porsche together with tuning company AMG made few long wheelbase 928 specials. Unlike 942, these had normal 928 headlights. One was presented to American Sunroof Corporation (ASC) founder and CEO Heinz Prechter. ASC was later partly responsible of making Porsche 944 S2 cabriolets.\nPorsche's Racing Department never officially entered or prepared a racing 928 for a pure works entry. Only once Porsche decided to make it obvious to the 911 enthusiasts that they usually tended to underrate the racing genes of the 928. Porsche then \"arranged\" this 928GTR to compete against the then dominant 911(993GTR) on the race track. In order not to offend sensibilities of their traditional 911/993GTR customers by officially challenging them with an outright Works - 928GTR, Porsche asked Max Moritz Racing, their longtime private racing partner from next door Reutlingen to enter this 928GTR Cup as a 'semi-works' car.\nIt didn't come as a surprise that the drivers were: Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder, Manuel Reuter (Porsche works pilots), also Harm Lagaay (then Head of Porsche's Design Studio). Vittorio Strosek sponsored MM with his Lightweight-Body-Parts and racing exhaust. The car was officially entered by Porsche-Club-Schwaben. Homologation minimum weight had to be, and actually is 1,370\u00a0kg (3,020\u00a0lb).\nLagaay reports that the car was very competitive and able to hold most 964 CUP GTs down, although the engine was no more than fine-tuned after having been chosen from a set of high power output specimen in Weissach. In the last race of the season at Hockenheim a crank-bearing ran dry. As the car was supposed to race in 1995 as well, it was made ready to continue its successful competition in the 1995 season. A fresh engine was installed, selected from the same lot of high output engines and tuned as before. In 1995 Porsche's 928 production came to an end, and the car consequently was not raced in the new season.\nThe late Max Moritz himself then added the car to his collection of historic vehicles.  It was not put on the road again until after his death, when the family sold the car in October 2004 - with only 24500\u00a0km on the clock ([11] ).\nFor the 1984 24 hours of Daytona, Porsche sent one of its experimental \"All-aluminum\" 928S to the Brumos Racing Team to be prepared with specific instruction not to modify the car in any way. Porsche wanted to promote the performance of the 928 to North America. The drivers Richard Attwood (GB), Vic Elford (GB), Howard Meister (USA) and Bob Hagestad (USA) were told to just \"drive the car\". During practice for the 24-hour race the drivers found the car to be somewhat unstable on the high banks of Daytona and wanted to add a rear wing to the car; Porsche denied the request. The Brumos team tinkered with the suspension set up to make the car more stable. The car finished in 15th overall and 4th in the GTO class. One driver stated in an interview later on, that were it not for a lengthy pit stop to fix some body damage, they would have finished in the top 5 overall. The car was then returned to Porsche and is now in the Porsche Museum.\nA 928S from Raymond Boutinaud also competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1983 & 1984 with a 22nd-place finish in 1984. The same car also competed in 1000k races at Spa, Brands Hatch and Silverstone in 1984, but with little success. It has been rumored that the Raymond Boutinaud 928S was also an \"all-aluminum\" car from Porsche but that has been unfounded.\nOn August 7, 1986 American racing driver Al Holbert set a speed record at Bonneville in a pre-production 928 S4. This 928 would turn 171.110\u00a0mph in the flying mile and 171.926\u00a0mph for the flying kilometer. In March 1986, the same car reportedly did 180+ mph at Nardo, but the Bonneville run netted United States Auto Club official record \"at the time\" for International Category A, Group 2, Class 9, for normally aspirated vehicles. That made 1987\u2019s 928 S4 the fastest non-turbocharged production car in the world.\nOn September 15, 2011 at the Bonneville Salt Flats, racing driver and owner of 928 Motorsports, LLC. Carl Fausett set the current world record as the fastest Porsche 928 in recorded history.[12][13] The record setting run was clocked by the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association at 216.63537\u00a0mph.[14] The car was a 900 BHP supercharged 6.54 liter 32 valve 928 specially built for the land speed record attempt.[15] dubbed by 928 Motorsports as the \"Rekordwagen\", which raced in the class Blown Gas Modified Sports B/BGMS.[14]\nThe Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is the second oldest auto race in the U.S.; a 12.42 mile (19.99\u00a0km) course with 156 turns starting at 9390\u00a0ft and ending at the 14110 foot summit of Pikes Peak.[16] In 2007, 2008 and 2009 American racing driver Carl Fausett took his specially prepared and supercharged 1978 Porsche 928 to the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb and competed in the Open Division. Fausett placed third in the Open Division in both 2007 and again in 2009, where he was also the fastest 2WD car.[17] At that time, much of the race course was gravel. Today the entire Pikes Peak Highway has been paved.\n", "Porsche 930": "The Porsche 930 is a sports car built by Porsche between 1975 and 1989, known to the public as the 911 Turbo. It was the maker's top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the time of its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany.\nPorsche began experimenting with turbocharging technology on their race cars during the late 1960s, and in 1972 began development on a turbocharged version of the 911. Porsche originally needed to produce the car in order to comply with homologation regulations and had intended on marketing it as a street legal race vehicle like the 1973 Carrera 2.7 RS. The FIA's Appendix \u201cJ\u201d rules that brought about the 911 Turbo Carrera RSR 2.1 in 1974 changed in 1975 and 1976. The FIA announced that cars for Group 4 and Group 5 had to be production cars and be available for sale to individual purchasers through manufacturer dealer networks. For the 1976 season, new FIA regulations required manufacturers to produce 400 cars within a twenty-four month period to gain approval for Group 4. Group 5 would require the car to be derived from a homologated model in Group 3 or 4.  Porsche's Group 4 entry was the 934, homologated on 6 December 1975. For Group 5, Porsche would create one of the most successful racing cars of all time, the 935. The 911 Turbo was put into production in 1975. While the original purpose of the 911 Turbo was to gain homologation for the 1976 racing season, it quickly became popular among car enthusiasts. Four-hundred cars were produced by the end of 1975. Since Porsche wanted to be racing for the 1976 season, they gained FIA homologation for the Porsche Turbo for Group 4 in Nr. 645 on 6 Dec 1975 and the 1,000th 911 Turbo was completed on 5 May 1976.\nErnst Fuhrmann adapted the turbo-technology originally developed for the 917/30 CAN-AM car to the 3.0 litre flat-six from the Carrera RS 3.0, creating what Porsche internally dubbed as the 930. The car utilises a single KKK turbocharger.[3]\nTotal output from the engine was 260\u00a0PS (191\u00a0kW; 256\u00a0hp) at 5,500 rpm and 329\u00a0N\u22c5m (243\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm, much more than the standard Carrera. With a compression ratio of 6.5:1. In order to ensure that the platform could make the most of the higher power output, a revised suspension, larger brakes and a stronger gearbox became part of the package, although some consumers were unhappy with Porsche's use of a four-speed transmission whilst a five-speed manual transmission was available in the \"lower trim\" Carrera. A \"whale tail\" rear spoiler was installed to help vent more air to the engine and to create more downforce at the rear of the vehicle, and wider rear wheels with upgraded tyres combined with flared wheel arches in order to increase the Turbo's width and grip, making it more stable.\nPorsche badged the vehicle simply as \"Turbo\" (although early U.S. units were badged as \"Turbo Carrera\") and introduced the vehicle at the Paris Auto Show in October 1974 before putting it on sale in the spring of 1975; export to the United States began in 1976.\nThe 930 proved very fast but also very demanding to drive, and due to its short wheelbase and rear engine layout, was prone to oversteer and turbo-lag.\nPorsche made its first and most significant changes to the 930 for 1978 model year, enlarging the engine to 3.3 litres and adding an air-to-air intercooler. By cooling the pressurized air charge, the intercooler helped increase power to 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW; 296\u00a0hp) at 5,500 rpm and 412\u00a0N\u22c5m (304\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) at 4,000 rpm (DIN); the rear 'whale tail' spoiler was re-profiled and raised slightly to make room for the intercooler and the spoiler was now called the 'tea tail' spoiler. The hydraulic clutch was also more civilised. The suspension benefitted from new anti-roll bars, firmer shock absorbers and larger diameter rear torsion bars. Porsche also upgraded the brakes to units similar to those used on the 917 race car. While the increase in displacement and addition of an intercooler increased power output and torque, these changes also increased the weight of the vehicle, especially the engine, which contributed to a substantial change in the handling and character of the car compared to the earlier 3.0-litre models.\nChanging emissions regulations in Japan and the U.S. forced Porsche to withdraw the 930 from those markets in 1980. It remained, however, available in Canada. Believing the luxurious 928 gran turismo would eventually replace the 911 as the top of the Porsche line, Fuhrmann cut back further development on the model, and it was not until his resignation that the company finally committed the financing to re-regulate the car.\nThe 930 remained available in Europe, and for 1983 a 335\u00a0PS (246\u00a0kW; 330\u00a0hp) performance option became available on a build-to-order basis from Porsche. With the add-on came a four-pipe exhaust system and an additional oil-cooler requiring a remodelled front spoiler and units bearing the add-on often featured additional ventilation holes in the rear fenders and modified rockers.\nBy the 1985 model year, 928 sales had risen slightly, but the question remained as to whether it would supersede the 911 as the company's premier model. Porsche re-introduced the 930 to the Japanese and U.S. markets in 1986 with an emission-controlled engine producing 282\u00a0PS (207\u00a0kW; 278\u00a0hp). At the same time Porsche introduced targa and cabriolet variants, both of which proved popular.\nPorsche discontinued the 930 after model year 1989 when its underlying \"G-Series\" platform was being replaced by the 964. In that year, Porsche introduced the 930 Speedster, a variant featuring body style akin to the 356 Speedster, the Speedster featured a humped rear end with a \"double bubble\" roof storage compartment and a short, raked  windshield along with a manually operated soft top. Only a handful of examples were produced making it one of the most rare 930 variants alongside the slantnose. The 1989 models were the first and last versions of the 930 to feature the G50 five-speed manual transmission. A turbo version of the 964 officially succeeded the 930 in 1991 with a modified version of the same 3.3 litre flat-six engine and a five-speed transmission.\nIn the late 1970s, Porsche tuners such as Ruf and Kremer (and others) began modifying customer cars with the \u201cslant nose\u201d front ends popularized by the factory racing 935s. Not a company to miss an obvious opportunity, in 1981 Porsche announced its own special-order slant nose front-end treatment. Originally available only in Europe, the 930S was then included as part of Porsche\u2019s 1985 program to make its full range of cars and accessories available worldwide.\nPorsche offered a \"Flachbau\" (\"flatnose\" or \"slantnose\") 930 under the \"Sonderwunschprogramm\" (special order program) beginning in 1981, an otherwise normal 930 with a 935-style slantnose instead of the normal 911 front end with the replacement of the famous \"bug eye\" headlamps with flip up units. Each Flachbau unit was handcrafted by remodeling the front fenders (option code M505). So a limited number of units were produced due to the fact that the package commanded a high premium price, and an initial premium of up to 60 per cent (highly individualized cars even more) over the standard price. 948 units were built in total. The Flachbau units delivered in Europe usually featured the 335\u00a0PS (246\u00a0kW; 330\u00a0hp) performance kit. The flat nose greatly contributed to the aerodynamics of the car and enabled it to accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 4.6 seconds and attain a top speed of 173\u00a0mph (278\u00a0km/h).\nCar and Driver recorded a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 4.9 seconds for both the 1975 and 1978 Porsche 911 Turbo, they shared first place in the \"quickest cars of the 1970s\" ranking with a 0.4 second lead.[11]\n", "Porsche 944": "The Porsche 944 is a sports car built by Porsche from 1982 to 1991. A front-engined, rear-wheel drive mid-level model based on the 924 platform, the 944 was available in coup\u00e9 or cabriolet body styles, with either naturally aspirated or turbocharged engines. \nIntended to be produced into the 1990s, major revisions planned for a 944 \"S3\" model were eventually combined into the 968, which became its replacement. Over 163,000 944s were produced, making it the most successful car line in Porsche history until the introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera.\nThe Porsche 924 had originally been a project of VW-Porsche a joint Porsche/Volkswagen company created to develop and produce the 914 which was sold in Europe as both a Porsche and a Volkswagen. In 1972, a replacement for the Volkswagen version of the 914, code named EA-425 began development. The model was to be sold as an Audi as part of the VW-Audi-Porsche marketing arrangement. Porsche was to have its own version.[1] At one point, VW head Rudolf Leidig, declared the EX-425 was going to be a VW exclusively, thus denying Porsche of a 914 replacement. Although testing had begun in the Spring of 1974, Volkswagen cancelled the EX-425 program because of significant financial losses due to declining sales and rising development costs for new vehicles, as well as the departure of Leidig. The recently released Volkswagen Scirocco was expected to fill the sports coup\u00e9 market segment. \nThis led Porsche to market an entry level car to replace the Porsche 912E, which was a US-only stop-gap model for 1976, and their model of 914, which was discontinued in 1975. Porsche purchased the design and the finished development with a Bosch L-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system. The vehicle received positive reviews, but was criticized by Porsche enthusiasts for its Audi-sourced 2\u00a0L engine. In 1979, Porsche introduced a Turbocharged 924 to increase performance, but this model carried a high price. Rather than scrap the design, Porsche decided to develop the 944, as they had with generations of the 911; although model numbers would change, the 924 would provide the basis for its replacement.\nPorsche re-worked the platform and a new all-alloy 2,479\u00a0cc (2.5\u00a0L; 151.3\u00a0cu\u00a0in) inline-four engine, bore 100\u00a0mm (3.94\u00a0in) X stroke 78.9\u00a0mm (3.11\u00a0in), that was, in essence, half of the 928's 5.0\u00a0L V8, although very few parts were actually interchangeable. Not typical in luxury sports cars, the four-cylinder engine was chosen for fuel efficiency and size, because it had to be fitted from below on the Neckarsulm production line. To overcome roughness caused by the unbalanced secondary forces that are typical of inline four-cylinder engines, Porsche included two counter-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. Invented in 1904 by British engineer Frederick Lanchester, and further developed and patented in 1975 by Mitsubishi Motors, balance shafts carry eccentric weights which produce inertial forces that balance out the unbalanced secondary forces, making a four-cylinder engine feel as smooth as a six-cylinder. Porsche spent some time trying to develop their own system, but when they realized that they could not improve on Mitsubishi's, they chose to pay the licensing fees rather than come up with a variation just different enough to circumvent the patent.[2] The licensing fees were about $7-8 per car, which translated to about $100 (equivalent to $254 in 2017) for the consumer to pay.[2] The engine was factory-rated at 150\u00a0hp (112\u00a0kW; 152\u00a0PS) in its U.S. configuration. Revised bodywork with wider wheel arches, similar to that of the 924 Carrera GT, a fresh interior and upgrades to the braking and suspension systems rounded out the major changes.\nPorsche introduced the 944 for MY 1982. It was slightly faster (despite having a poorer drag co-efficient) than the 924, the 944 was better equipped and more refined than the 924; it had better handling and stopping power, and was more comfortable to drive. The factory-claimed 0-60\u00a0mph time of less than 9 seconds (8.3 seconds according to \"Porsche the Ultimate Guide\" By Scott Faragher). The factory-claimed top speed of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) was also pessimistic, Autocar having verified a top speed of 137\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h)[verification needed]. The car had nearly even front to rear weight distribution (50.7% front/49.3% rear) thanks to the rear transaxle balancing out the engine in the front.[3] North American-market cars have bigger bumpers and the front one has a larger rubber portion, replacing the auxiliary lights mounted there for the rest of the world.[2]\nIn mid-1985, the 944 underwent its first significant changes. These included: a new dash and door panels, embedded radio antenna, upgraded alternator (from 90 amp to 115 amp), increased oil sump capacity, new front and rear cast alloy control arms and semi-trailing arms, larger fuel tank, optional heated and powered seats, Porsche HiFi sound system, and revisions in the mounting of the transaxle to reduce noise and vibration. The front windshield was now a flush-mounted unit. The \"cookie cutter\" style wheels used in the early 944s were upgraded to new \"phone dial\" style wheels (Fuchs wheels remained an option). 1985 model year cars incorporating these changes are sometimes referred to as \"1985B\", \"85.5\" or \"1985\u00bd\" cars.\nFor the 1987 model year, the 944 Motronic DME was updated, and newly incorporated anti-lock braking and airbags. Because of the ABS system, the wheel offset changed to 52\u00a0mm (2.047\u00a0in) and Fuchs wheels were no longer an option.\nIn early 1989 before the release of the 944S2, Porsche upgraded the 944 from the 2.5 to a 2.7\u00a0L engine, bore 104\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in), stroke 78.9\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in), with a rated 162\u00a0hp (121\u00a0kW) (versus 158\u00a0hp (118\u00a0kW) for the 1988 2.5\u00a0L version) and a significant increase in torque. In addition to the increase in displacement, the new motor featured a siamesed-cylinder block design and a different cylinder head which incorporated larger valves.[4]\nFor the 1986 model year, Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo, known internally as the 951. This had a turbocharged and intercooled version of the standard car's engine that produced 220\u00a0PS (162\u00a0kW) (217\u00a0bhp (162\u00a0kW) in the US) at 6000 rpm. In 1987, Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo and achieved a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 5.9 seconds. The Turbo was the first car using a ceramic port liner to retain exhaust gas temperature and new forged pistons and was also the first vehicle to produce identical power output with or without a catalytic converter. The Turbo also featured several other changes, such as improved aerodynamics, notably an integrated front bumper. This featured the widest turn signals (indicators) fitted to any production car, a strengthened gearbox with a different final drive ratio, standard external oil coolers for both the engine and transmission, standard 16\u00a0inch wheels (optional forged Fuchs wheels), and a slightly stiffer suspension (progressive springs) to handle the extra weight. The Turbo's front and rear brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 911, with Brembo 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs as ABS also came standard. Engine component revisions, more than thirty in all, were made to the 951 to compensate for increased internal loads and heat.\nChanges occurred for the 1987 model year. On the interior, the 1987 944 Turbo for North America became the first production car in the world to be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment. A low oil level light was added to the dash as well as a 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) speedometer as opposed to the 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h) speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos. Also included is the deletion of the transmission oil cooler, and a change in suspension control arms to reduce the car's scrub radius. The engine remained the same M44/51 as in the 1986 model.\nIn 1988, Porsche introduced the Turbo S with a more powerful engine (designation number M44/52) rated at 250\u00a0PS (247\u00a0bhp; 184\u00a0kW) @ 6000 rpm and 350\u00a0N\u22c5m (258\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4000 rpm of torque [5] (standard 944 Turbo 220\u00a0hp (164\u00a0kW) and 243\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (329\u00a0N\u22c5m)). This higher output was achieved by using a larger KKK K26-8 turbocharger housing and revised engine mapping which allowed maintaining maximum boost until 5800 rpm, compared to the standard 944 Turbo the boost would decrease from 1.75\u00a0bar (175\u00a0kPa; 25.4\u00a0psi) at 3000 rpm to 1.52\u00a0bar (152\u00a0kPa; 22.0\u00a0psi) at 5800 rpm. In June 1988, Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo S (with the advantage of shorter final drive gear) and achieved a 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) time of 5.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 13.9 seconds at 101\u00a0mph (163\u00a0km/h). Top speed was factory rated at 162\u00a0mph (261\u00a0km/h).\nThe 944 Turbo S's suspension had the \"M030\" option consisting of Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting threaded collars on the front struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8\u00a0mm (1.055\u00a0in) hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 inches (178\u00a0mm) in the front, and 9 inches (229\u00a0mm) in the rear with 52\u00a0mm (2.047\u00a0in) offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 in the front and 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited-slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.\nThe 944 Turbo S interior featured power seats for both driver and passenger, where the majority of the factory-built Turbo S models sported a \"Burgundy plaid\" (Silver Rose edition) but other interior/exterior colors were available. A 10-speaker sound system and equalizer + amp was a common option with the Turbo S and S/SE prototypes. Only the earlier 1986, 250\u00a0bhp (190\u00a0kW) prototypes featured a \"special wishes custom interior\" options package.\nIn 1989 and later production, the 'S' designation was dropped from the 944 Turbo S, and all 944 Turbos featured the Turbo S enhancements as standard, however the \"M030\" suspension and the Club Sport wheels were not part of that standard.[6] The 944 Turbo S was the fastest production four cylinder car of its time.[7]\nFor the 1987 model year, the 944S \"Super\" was introduced. The 944S featured a high performance naturally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve 190\u00a0PS (140\u00a0kW; 187\u00a0hp) version of the 2.5\u00a0L engine (M44/40) featuring a self-adjusting timing belt tensioner. This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928\u00a0S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. Floating 944 calipers were standard, but the rear wheel brake circuit pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides in front of the body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 \u2013 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232\u00a0km/h (144\u00a0mph) top speed due to a 2857\u00a0lb weight. It also featured an improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer/DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10.9:1 compression ratio cylinder head. Like the 944 Turbo, the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling, Larger front and rear anti-roll bars, revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2.5\u00a0L DOHC higher 6,800 rpm rev limit. Dual safety air bags, limited-slip differential, and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S.\nA Club Sport touring package (M637) was available as was the lightweight 16 inch CS/Sport Fuch 16x7 and 16x9 forged alloy wheels. This SC version car was raced in Canada, Europe and in the U.S. IMSA Firehawk Cup Series. Production was only during 1987 and 1988. It was superseded in 1989 by the 'S2' 944 edition. The 1987 944S power-to-weight ratio was such that it was able to accelerate from 0 to 62\u00a0mph in 6.5 seconds thus matching the acceleration of its newer larger displacement 3.0\u00a0L 944\u00a0S2 sibling.\nIn 1989 the 944S2 was introduced, powered by a 211\u00a0PS (155\u00a0kW; 208\u00a0hp) normally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve 3.0\u00a0L version of the 944S engine. With a bore of 104\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in) and a stroke of 88\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in), it was the largest production 4-cylinder engine of its time.[8] The 944S2 also received a revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 3.0\u00a0L M44/41 powerplant. The 944S2 had the same rounded nose and a rear valance found on the Turbo model. Performance was quoted as 0-60\u00a0mph in 6.0 seconds (0\u2013100\u00a0km/h 6.8 s), with a top speed of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph) via manual transmission. A Club Sport touring package (M637) was also available. Dual air bags (left hand drive models), limited-slip differential and ABS were optional. Series 90 16-inch cast alloy wheels were standard equipment.\nIn 1989, Porsche released the 944 S2 Cabriolet, a first for the 944 line that featured the cabriolet body built by ASC (American Sunroof Company) in Weinsberg, Germany. The first year of production included sixteen 944 S2 Cabriolet for the U.S. market. For the 1990 model year, Porsche produced 3,938 944 S2 Cabriolets for all markets including right-hand drive units for the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa.\nThis car was raced, including the British championship that was called the Porsche Motorsport Championship. Production was during 1989, 1990, and 1991. The 944 S2 power-to-weight ratio was such that it was able to accelerate from 0 to 60\u00a0mph in 6.5 seconds.\nIn February 1991, Porsche released the 944 Turbo Cabriolet, which combined the Turbo S's 250\u00a0hp (186\u00a0kW) engine with the cabriolet body built by ASC (American Sunroof Company) in Weinsberg, Germany. Porsche initially announced that 600 would be made; ultimately 625 were built, 100 of which were right-hand drive for the United Kingdom, Japanese, Australian, and South African markets. None were imported to the U.S. and The Americas.\nIn early 1990, Porsche engineers began working on what they had intended to be the third evolution of the 944, the S3. As they progressed with the development process, they realized that so many parts were being changed that they had produced an almost entirely new vehicle. Porsche consequently shifted development from the 944 S/S2 to the car that would replace the 944 entirely, the 968. The 944's final year of production was 1991 with over 4,000 cars built and sold. In 1992 the 968 debuted and was sold alongside the 928 through 1995, when both water-cooled front engine models were discontinued.\nIn February 1992 verbal agreement was given to Porsche UK from Stuttgart for the production of a prototype \u201cSports Equipment\u201d 944S2 Model with following approval to construct 15 vehicles for the UK market from the last 944S2 Coupes produced. A unique 30mm lower fully adjustable Koni Suspension with Turbo rated springs was used in combination with upgraded 31mm front stabiliser bar & adjustable rear bar. Engine output was increased to 225BHP with re-map to improve Torque above 4,250rpm and unique sports exhaust system. Cosmetically the \u201cSE\u201d was fitted with Porsche colour matched \u201cPorsche Sport\u201d steering wheel, Bi-plane rear spoiler, SE side decals and rear badging. The modifications resulted in improved acceleration in higher rev range, flatter cornering, more precise steering, improved responsiveness, confidence inspiring handling leading to an overall sharper response. The 944S2 SE prototypes are regarded as the inspiration and in part development for the later 968 Club Sport.\nA grand total 163,192 cars in the 944 family were produced between 1982 and 1991. This made it the most successful car line in Porsche's history until the introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera.\nA total of 113,070 944s were made between 1982 and 1989, with 56,921 being exported to the United States. A project joint venture with Porsche and Callaway produced 16 specially built turbo 944's for the U.S. in 1983.\nA total of 25,245 944 Turbos were made, with 13,982 being exported to the United States.\n* - Includes 12 Turbo S (951) / SE in UK (952), factory built prototypes of which 10 were exported to markets outside Germany.\n\n** - Includes 1635 Turbo S \n\n\u2020 - Includes 251 Turbo Cabriolet. A different source, Jerry Sloniger's\narticle in the October 1991 issue of Excellence, indicates that the\nfactory built 525, of which 255 were exported to markets outside Germany.\n< >\"CUP\" designates a cup car\nspecial edition race car.\nA total of 12,936 944S models were produced from 1987 to 1988, with 8,815 being exported to the United States. In 1985 a Prototype 944S Cabriolet 'Studie' built by Braun was powered by the 2.5\u00a0L 16 valve which developed 185\u00a0hp, forerunner of the later production 944S and S2 Cabriolet models.[citation needed]\n* - Includes CS - Club Sport's built for US, and ROW markets.\nA total of around 14,071 944S2s were made between 1989 and 1991, with 3,650 being exported to the United States.\nThe 944 was on Car and Driver's Ten Best list from 1983 through 1985, and the Turbo made the list for 1986.\nIn 1984, Car and Driver named the 944 the Best Handling Production Car in America.\n", "Porsche 959": "The Porsche 959 is a sports car manufactured by German car manufacturer  Porsche from 1986 to 1993, first as a Group B rally car and later as a road legal production car designed to satisfy FIA homologation regulations requiring at least 200 units be produced.[3]\nThe twin-turbocharged 959 was the world's fastest street-legal production car when introduced, achieving a top speed of 197\u00a0mph (317\u00a0km/h), with some variants even capable of achieving 211 miles per hour (339\u00a0km/h). During its production run, the 959 was considered as the most technologically advanced road-going sports car ever built, and forerunner of all forthcoming sports cars. It was one of the first high-performance vehicles with all-wheel drive, providing the basis for Porsche's first all-wheel drive 911 Carrera 4 model. Its performance convinced Porsche executives to make all-wheel drive standard on all turbocharged versions of the 911 starting with the 993. The twin-turbo system utilised on the 959 also made its way to future turbocharged Porsche sports cars. In 2004, Sports Car International named the 959 number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.\nDevelopment of the 959 (originally called the Gruppe B) started in 1981, shortly after the company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's chief engineer at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on for years to come and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new development mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the approval to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.\nPorsche developed an existing engine instead of creating a new one from scratch. The powerplant was a twin-turbocharged flat-six engine DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, fuel fed by Bosch Motronic fuel injection with air-cooled cylinders and water-cooled heads, and a displacement of 2,849\u00a0cc (2.8\u00a0L; 173.9\u00a0cu\u00a0in), about half a litre less than a contemporary 911 engine. It was coupled to a unique manual transmission offering five forward speeds plus a \"gel\u00e4nde\" (terrain) off-road gear, as well as reverse. The engine had originally been developed for the \"935/78 Moby Dick\" race car and then been redeveloped slightly for the short-lived Porsche Indy Car and several other projects before being modified a last time for use in the 961, the 959's racing counterpart. The water-cooled four-valve cylinder heads combined with the air-cooled cylinders and sequential turbochargers allowed Porsche to extract 450\u00a0PS (444\u00a0hp; 331\u00a0kW) @ 6500 rpm and 500\u00a0N\u22c5m (369\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 5000 rpm of torque [4] [5] from the compact, efficient and rugged power unit.[6] The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth delivery of power across the engine speed band, in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche's other turbocharged engines of the period. The engine was used virtually unchanged, in the 959 road car as well.\nTo create a rugged, lightweight shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for the body panels and chassis construction along with a Nomex floor, instead of the steel floor normally used on their production cars.[7] The vehicle's weight of 1,450\u00a0kg (3,197\u00a0lb) helped to achieve its high performance.\nPorsche also developed the car's aerodynamics, which were designed to increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had a fixed suspension system). Its drag coefficient was as low as 0.31 and aerodynamic lift was eliminated completely.[8]\nThe 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) all-wheel-drive system. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a \"super\" street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of the available power to the rear wheels, helping make the most of the rear-traction bias that occurs at such times.[9] It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tire and equipped with a built-in tire pressure monitoring system.[10]\nThe Porsche 959 was actually produced at Baur, not at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen, on an assembly line with Porsche inspectors overseeing the finished bodies. Most of Porsche's special order interior leather work was also done by the workers at Baur.\nThe 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show was chosen for the unveiling of the Porsche Group B prototype. Even in the closing hours of October 9, finishing touches were being applied to the car to go on display the next morning. After the first two prototypes, the bodywork was modified to include air vents in the front and rear wheel housings, as well as intake holes behind the doors. The first prototype receiving those modifications was code named \"F3\", and was destroyed in the first crash test.[citation needed]\nThe road version of the 959 debuted at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show as a 1986 model, but numerous issues delayed production by more than a year. The car was manufactured in two levels of trim, \"Sport\" and \"Komfort\", corresponding to the trim with more creauture comforts and a more track focused trim. First customer deliveries of the 959 street variant began in 1987, and the car debuted at a cost of US$225,000 each, still less than half what it cost Porsche to build each car. Production ended in 1988 with 292 959s from the assembly line. In total, 337 cars were built, including 37 prototypes and pre-production models.[1] At least one 959 and one 961 remain in the Porsche historic hall in Stuttgart, Germany.\nIn 1992/1993, Porsche built eight more 959s assembled from spare parts from the inventory at the manufacturing site in Zuffenhausen.[1] All eight were \"Komfort\" versions: four in red and four in silver. These cars were much more expensive (DM 747,500) than the earlier ones (DM 420,000). The later cars also featured a newly developed speed-sensitive damper system. The cars were sold to selected collectors after being driven by works personnel for some time[1] and are today by far the most sought-after 959s.\nThe 959 was not street legal in the United States prior to 1999 when the \"Show or Display\" law was passed, although an unknown number were imported via the \"grey market\" during the late 1980s as show pieces. During the model's development Porsche refused to provide the United States Department of Transportation with the four 959s they required for crash testing, and the car was never certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for street use in the U.S. In 2001, with the passage of \"Show and Display\", the crash test requirements were removed and importation of the 959 was allowed, assuming the car could meet the emissions standards applicable in 1987. The 959 could be fitted with a catalytic converter and a re-programmed computer which allowed it to meet those emissions requirements. As the 959 was pre-1996, it was not be required to pass any emissions testing anymore: due to the fact that most 959s are now over 25 years old and therefore completely legal for US importation, they were no longer required to comply with show and display laws.\nTest results for the 959 \"Sport\" (450 PS):\nTest results for the 959 \"Komfort\" version (450 PS):\nIf desired, even more power was available to customer cars by Porsche. According to Paul Fr\u00e8re there was an optional 530\u00a0PS (390\u00a0kW; 523\u00a0hp) factory upgrade, with an increased top speed 209\u00a0mph (336\u00a0km/h) along with the 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h acceleration time reduced to 3.4 seconds.[17]\nThe Porsche 959 S was a package available to the 959 \"Sport\" that increased power output to 515\u00a0PS (380\u00a0kW; 510\u00a0bhp) thus resulting in a top speed of 339\u00a0km/h (211\u00a0mph) as tested by Auto, Motor und Sport at Nardo in 1988.[18][19]\nWhen Porsche began development of the 959, it looked toward Group B racing as a road-racing laboratory with which to develop technology for production cars. When Group B became focused on rallying events, however, Porsche felt the relevance to production cars was greatly reduced,[citation needed] and the goal of the 959 project shifted to frank state-of-the-art, cost-no-object technological innovation.\nIn 1984, however, three 911s modified to 959 specifications (due to the requirement that Group B cars be based on production cars with at least 200 built) were used in the Paris-Dakar Rally, with Jacky Ickx the prime motivator. By 1985, the 959 rally variant was ready, but it experienced a disappointing start: all three cars failed to finish. However, in 1986 the 959 finished 1-2. The 959 was never seriously considered for a Group B Rally season; the cost of completing a full season far outweighed any technical information that would have been gained.\nIn 1986, the racing variant of the 959, the Porsche 961, made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by Ren\u00e9 Metge partnering Claude Ballot-L\u00e9na, it finished first in its class and 7th overall. It returned in 1987 but failed to finish after a spin (missed gear change) while in 11th place by Canadian/Dutch driver Kees Nierop of Vancouver. Upon re-joining the track, the car was observed on TV monitors in the Porsche pits to be on fire and the driver was told to stop and get out of the car. Sadly Nierop pulled over between marshal stations and this extra time taken to get to the car by the marshals allowed the fire to consume most of the rear end and destroy the car. Thus ending short-lived the career of the 961. It was later repaired and put on display at the Porsche Museum.\nIn 2003, Canepa Design initiated a 959 upgrade program. By making modifications to the 959's turbochargers, exhaust system and computer-control systems, Canepa enabled the 959 to pass emissions requirements (thereby making it street-legal in the United States). The new configuration allowed parallel turbo charging and simplified diagnostics. Canepa also modified the 959's lightweight magnesium wheels to allow tyres without the unique Dunlop Denloc bead. A modern Michelin high-performance tyres capable of handling the increased performance could then be mounted. The original RE71 tires were available in the U.S. and have always been more than capable of handling the power output of the 959.[20]\nIn April 2018, Canepa announced the Generation III package for the 959. The package includes the replacement of the standard sequential twin-turbo system with a pair of Borg Warner parallel twin-turbos, new wiring harness and a new engine control unit along with a new exhaust system and a new clutch to handle the extra power produced by the car. The package enables the engine to produce 569\u00a0kW (774\u00a0PS; 763\u00a0hp) and 861\u00a0N\u22c5m (635\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque. The package also includes the replacement of the standard suspension system with an evolution of the 959 S' suspension system with modern dampers and titanium springs for improved handling and ride-height along with new tyres. The headlamps are replaced with new Xenon headlamps, providing better illumination than the original units.\nIn addition to the package, Canepa also introduced a limited production of the 959 SC (Sport Canepa) limited to 50 cars. The 959 SC comes standard with the Generation III Canepa upgrade along with a body overhaul and a new paint-to-sample paint job according to the customer's desire that takes 500 hours to complete. The car also features a reworked leather interior which is complimented with a steering wheel having hand-stiched leather and a more modern sound system with the interior alone taking 300 hours to complete. The process starts with a standard 959 and its teardown to the chassis with every rusty part replaced and every component coated with zinc. The package costs in excess of US$2 million including the cost of the car itself.[21]\nThe \"Gates 959\" is an infamous 959 owned by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.  Bill Gates bought his 959 before the model had Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency approval. The \"Gates 959\" was stored for 13 years by the Customs Service at the Port of San Francisco, until regulations were changed to allow \"Autos of Interest\" to be imported with limitations on their use.[22] Gates helped pass the \"Show or Display\" law.[22][23][24]\n", "Porsche 964": "The Porsche 964 is the company's internal name for the Porsche 911 manufactured and sold between 1989 and 1994. Designed by Benjamin Dimson through January 1986, it featured significant styling revisions over previous 911 models, most prominently the more integrated bumpers. It was the first car to be offered with Porsche's optional Tiptronic automatic transmission and all wheel drive as options.\nType 964 (\"nine-sixty-four\", or \"nine-six-four\") is Porsche's internal code name for the 911 Carrera 2 and 911 Carrera 4 models, which were badged simply as \"Carrera 2\" and \"Carrera 4\". \"964\" is used by automotive publications and enthusiasts to distinguish them from other generations of the Carrera.\nThe 964 was considered to be 85% new as compared to its predecessor, the Carrera 3.2. The first 964s available in 1989 were all wheel drive equipped \"Carrera 4\" models; Porsche added the rear wheel drive Carrera 2 variant to the range in 1990. Both variants were available as a coupe, Targa or Cabriolet. The 964 Carrera was the last generation sold with the traditional removable Targa roof until the 2011 991 (993, 996, and 997 versions used instead a complex glass-roof \"greenhouse\" system). A new naturally aspirated engine called the M64 was used for 964 models, with a flat-6 displacement of 3.6 litres.\nPorsche substantially revised the suspension, replacing torsion bars with coil springs and shock absorbers.[2] Power steering and ABS brakes were added to the 911 for the first time; both were standard. The exterior bumpers and fog lamps became flush with the car for better aerodynamics. A new electric rear spoiler raised at speeds above 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and lowered down flush with the rear engine lid at lower speeds. A revised interior featured standard dual airbags beginning in 1990 for all North American production cars. A new automatic climate control system provided improved heating and cooling. Revised instrumentation housed a large set of warning lights that were tied into the car's central warning system, alerting the driver to a possible problem or malfunction.\nEngine design: Air/oil-cooled, horizontally opposed, dry-sump lubrication, rear-mounted \nEngine displacement: 3,600 cc (220 cu in) \nCylinders: Six \nBore and stroke: 100 x 76.4\u00a0mm (3.94 x 3.01\u00a0in) \nCompression ratio: 11.3\u00a0: 1 \nFuel/ignition: Electronic fuel injection, DME controller, with twin-spark with knock regulation \nCrankshaft: Forged, seven main bearings \nBlock and heads: aluminum alloy \nValve Train: Single Overhead cam (Sohc)- one per bank, double chain drive \nPower: 184\u00a0kW/247\u00a0hp (SAE net)/250 PS (DIN) at 6,100\u00a0rpm \nTorque: 310 N\u00b7m/228\u00a0lb\u00b7ft at 4,800\u00a0rpm \nEngine speed limitation: 6,700\u00a0rpm\nThe suspension was redesigned using coil springs instead of torsion bars, the first major engineering changes since the original 911.

It was based on Porsche's 911 \"Carrera Cup\" race car and harked back to the 2.7 and 3.0 RS and RSR models. It featured a revised version of the standard engine, titled M64/03 internally, with an increased power output of 260\u00a0bhp (194\u00a0kW; 264\u00a0PS) and lightweight flywheel coupled to the G50/10 transmission with closer ratios, asymmetrical Limited Slip Differential and steel syncromesh. A track-oriented suspension system with 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) lower ride height, stiffer springs, shocks and adjustable stabilizer bars without power steering (RHD UK cars did have power steering).\nA stripped-out interior devoid of power windows or seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, sound deadening or a stereo system (optionally fitted) and new racing-bucket front seats were part of the package. The trunk hood was made of aluminum and the chassis was seam welded. Wheels were made of magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. The Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds (155\u00a0kg) lighter than the US version Carrera 2 model. Also available were a heavier Touring variant (with sound deadening, power seats (optional), undercarriage protection and power windows) and an N/GT racing variant with a stripped, blank metal interior and a roll cage. They also came with optional lights on the visors.\nA later ultra-limited production version, the Carrera 3.8 RS featuring the Turbo body and a 300\u00a0bhp (224\u00a0kW; 304\u00a0PS) 3.8 litre version of the M64 motor was sold briefly in Europe.[1] This engine was bored out by 2\u00a0mm for a total of 3,746\u00a0cc, and was also available in a more powerful competition version called the 3.8 RSR.[1]\nThe Carrera RS was not sold in the United States because Porsche Cars North America felt the car's aggressive tuning was not suited to the American market. In 1992, 45 US-legal cars that were very similar to the Carrera RS were imported to the US for a proposed \"Porsche Carrera Cup\" racing series. This Carrera Cup series was to function as a support race for the American CART racing series just as European Carrera Cup has supported Formula One.\nThese 45 cars were identical to a Carrera RS other than having airbags (with required electric windows), alarm system, American lighting, American bumpers, aluminum wheels, and standard seats. The cars otherwise had the lightweight seam welded chassis, lightweight interior trim, aluminum hood, lightweight door glass, suspension, brakes, G50/10 transmission and M64/03 engine etc. of the Carrera RS. These cars were approximately 200 pounds (90\u00a0kg) lighter than a normal US Carrera 2 model.\nThe plan was for Andial, the then equivalent of what is now Porsche Motorsport US, to convert these cars to full racing specification, however, due to lack of sponsor support for the Carrera Cup series, it was cancelled before it began. The 45 cars imported to the US for this series were then sold, quietly without any advertising so as not to compete with the new RS America, through normal dealer channels. These cars were supplied with a dash plaque which indicated that they were the \"Carrera Cup US Edition\".\nIn order to please devoted American 911 enthusiasts who wanted an RS model, Porsche produced the RS America. The RS America was produced as a model year 1993 and 1994 car based on the US Carrera 2. The cars were offered in standard colors red, black and white and optional colors midnight blue metallic and polar silver. Several paint to order cars were manufactured in speed yellow. The RS America featured a distinctive \"whale tail\" spoiler, a partially stripped interior with flat door panels (from the European RS) and carpeting along with a luggage shelf replacing the rear seats. Cloth covered sports seats, 17\u00a0inch wheels and M030 Sports Suspension were fitted as standard. The logo \"RS America\" was written on the deck lid along with an \"RS\" logo in front of the rear wheels. Deleted to save weight were power steering, cruise control, powered side mirrors, air-conditioning, sunroof and radio, although the air-conditioning, sunroof and radio as well as a limited slip differential could be ordered as options. The RS America was listed by Porsche as weighing 2,954 pounds (1,340\u00a0kg), 77 pounds (35\u00a0kg) lighter than the weight listed for a stock Carrera 2. The standard US Carrera 2 brakes, engine and gearbox were used.\nEngine Design: Air-cooled or oil-cooled, horizontally opposed (flat), dry-sump lubrication, rear-mounted engine \nDisplacement: 3,600 cc (220 cu in) \nCylinders: Six \nBore and Stroke: 3.94 x 3.01 in (100.0 x 76.4\u00a0mm)\nCompression ratio: 11.3\u00a0: 1 \nFuel/Ignition: Electronic fuel injection, DME controller, twin-spark with knock regulation \nCrankshaft: Forged, 8 main bearings \nBlock and heads: aluminum alloy \nValve Train: Overhead cam, one per bank, double chain drive \nPower: 191\u00a0kW/260\u00a0hp (SAE net) at 6,100\u00a0rpm \nTorque: 312 N\u00b7m/230\u00a0lb\u00b7ft at 4,800\u00a0rpm\nBased on the Porsche 964 was the 1990 racing version for the new Porsche Carrera Cup. In addition to an increase in output by 11\u00a0kW to 195\u00a0kW (265\u00a0hp) the 964 Cup had a welded roll-cage, a modified chassis set-up and the ground clearance was 55\u00a0mm lower than on the standard version. To reduce weight: the interior and the sound-proofing material was removed. The gear ratios were modified and it had non power-steering. The vehicle did have a catalytic converter and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).\nIn 1992, the 964 Cup had a major revision. The vehicle now had the body from the 964RS and the engine now produced 202\u00a0kW (275\u00a0hp).  Another major change was that the ABS could be switched off in the event of emergency braking or whilst the car was going backwards. The vehicle now had 18 inch magnesium rims, which replaced the aluminium rims. The car was lowered by a further 20\u00a0mm.\nPorsche introduced the 964 Turbo model in March, 1990[3] as the successor to the 930. Unfortunately, they hadn't had the necessary time to develop a turbocharged version of the 3.6 litre M64 engine, and chose to re-use the 3.3 litre engine from the 930, with several minor revisions that made the engine smoother, less prone to turbo lag and more powerful, with a total output of 320\u00a0PS (240\u00a0kW; 320\u00a0hp) @ 5750 rpm. A total of 3,660 of the 964 Turbos were built.\nIn 1992, the 3.3 litre Turbo S was introduced. The standard turbo model was modified to produce  381\u00a0PS (280\u00a0kW; 376\u00a0hp)  with bigger injectors and more boost and more aggressive camshafts and with a lightweight interior and limited \"creature comforts\" the Turbo S was one of the fastest cars on the road.  With lowered suspension, a front strut brace and manual steering, the Turbo S was geared to performance. 86 cars were produced.[4]\nPorsche released the 964 Turbo 3.6 in January, 1993,[3] now featuring a turbocharged version of the 3.6 litre M64 engine and producing 359.95\u00a0PS (264.74\u00a0kW; 355.03\u00a0hp) @ 5500 rpm, the 3.6 litre powered Turbo was produced only for model year 1993/1994, with fewer than 1,500 of them produced in total, making it one of the rarest and most sought after Porsches produced since the 959.\nAt the end of 964 production in 1994, the Porsche factory had some 90 Turbo chassis left.  These were all transferred to Porsche Exclusiv and built as the very special Turbo 3.6S. The Turbo 3.6S was available either with the traditional 964 Turbo 3.6 body, or with the exclusive flachbau 'slant nose' option.\nOption X83 (Japan), X84 (non-US) and X85 (US), the Turbo S Flachbau, was available in the US as a $60,179 USD option on top of the base price $99,000 USD Turbo 3.6. The flachbau option was available when ordering the no charge '36S' option '1994 Turbo \"S\" Model' at a price of $60,179. In addition to the slantnose fenders, it also included the 'X88' option which included the 'Turbo S' motor, the 'X92' Exclusive front spoiler, 'X93' Exclusive rear spoiler and 'X99' Exclusive rear fender vents. The flachbau option was designed around the model 968 front end, and the 930 style Turbo S front end for Japan (right down to the sill covers on the fenders). 39 Models were made for US markets, 27 for international market and 10 for Japan, all in Polar Silver (http://flachbau.com).[5]\nTurbo 3.3: \nBore and stroke: 97 x 74.4\u00a0mm (3.82 x 2.93 in) \nDisplacement: 3,299 cc \nCompression ratio: 7.0:1 \nPower: 320\u00a0PS (235\u00a0kW; 316\u00a0hp) @ 5750 rpm\nTorque: 450\u00a0N\u22c5m (332\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4500 rpm\nTurbo 3.3 S: \nBore and stroke: 97 x 74.4\u00a0mm (3.82 x 2.93 in) \nDisplacement 3,299 cc \nCompression Ratio 7.0:1 \nPower: 381\u00a0PS (280\u00a0kW; 376\u00a0hp) @ 5750 rpm \nTorque: 508\u00a0N\u22c5m (375\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @5000 rpm / 490\u00a0N\u22c5m (361\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4800 rpm\nTurbo 3.6: \nBore and stroke: 100 x 76.4\u00a0mm (3.94 x 3.01 in) \nDisplacement 3,600 cc \nCompression Ratio 7.5:1 \nPower: 360\u00a0PS (265\u00a0kW; 355\u00a0hp) @ 5500 rpm \nTorque: 520\u00a0N\u22c5m (384\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4200 rpm\nTurbo 3.6S: \nBore and stroke: 100 x 76.4\u00a0mm (3.94 x 3.01 in) \nDisplacement 3,600 cc \nCompression Ratio 7.5:1 \nPower: 385\u00a0PS (283\u00a0kW; 380\u00a0hp) @ 5750 rpm\nTorque: 520\u00a0N\u22c5m (384\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 5000 rpm\nZF Clutch type limited slip\n20% lock under acceleration\n100% lock under deceleration\nIn 1993 Porsche introduced the 30th Anniversary C4 to commemorate 30 years since the 911 launch in 1963. Based on the wider turbo body and wheels with 4 wheel drive, but with a normally aspirated engine and standard small lifting wing. This version was the start of a line that continued with the 993 C4S and 996 C4S.\nAlso in 1993 Porsche developed a highly tuned 964 Turbo S prototype for use in international motorsport. This car, known as the Turbo S Le Mans GT (or simply Turbo S LM-GT), was based on the standard road-legal Turbo S, but stripped down and modified for circuit use. A deep chin spoiler was added to the front, while two air inlets were added just above the rear wheel arches. An adjustable racing rear wing was added on top of the standard Turbo's wing. Wider wheel arches were used to house 12-inch (300\u00a0mm) wide racing slicks. The interior was completely stripped, a rollcage added, and the windows replaced with plastic. The engine used was not the standard road-car unit, but a smaller twin-turbocharged 3.2 liter unit which produced 475 hp.[6]\nThe Turbo S LM-GT made its debut at the 1993 12 Hours of Sebring where the car finished seventh overall and first in its class with the Brumos Porsche racing team.  From there, the car was entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, running under the guise of the Porsche factory team.  The car would however fail to finish after the engine was damaged early in the race.  For 1994, the Turbo S LM-GT would be moved to the hands of Larbre Comp\u00e9tition, where a new 3.6 liter engine based on the 993 unit would be used in place of the 3.2 liter engine.  The team opened the year with a second-place finish at the 24 Hours of Daytona, before moving on to select rounds of the BPR Global GT Series.  The car would win all four races in which it competed, including the 1000 km Suzuka.  The Turbo S LM-GT would make a few select appearances in 1995 with Obermaier Racing before being retired.\nThe development work from the Turbo S LM-GT helped Porsche in creating the 993-generation 911 GT2 in 1995, which would be mass-produced and sold to racing customers. Some teams, unable to buy new 911 GT2s, developed their own twin-turbo racing versions of the 964 Turbo to mimic the Turbo S LM-GT, but lacked the success of the factory project.\nThere were two distinct incarnations of the air-cooled 911 Speedster. The first was the 1989 model year Speedster. Shown at the 1988 Frankfurt autoshow beside the upcoming Carrera 4, the 1989 Speedster actually shared more in common with the 930 turbo than with the upcoming 964 generation 911s, causing it to be looked upon, in retrospect, as a much inferior \"driver's car\" to the later 1994 Speedster. More than three quarters (641) of the 800 built had the \"Turbo look\" wide-body option.[7]\nThe 1994 Porsche 911 Speedster was available either in standard or lightweight trim called \u201cclubsport.\" Unlike the 1989 model, the 1994 Speedster was based on the new Carrera 2 platform and was not initially available with the \"Turbo look\" wide-body style.  The 1994 Speedster was designed to be a more focused \"driver's car\" and served as a hybrid between a 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet and a 964 RS. While it featured a softer suspension set up than the 964 RS, it offered almost none of the comforts of a normal 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet, though power windows were standard and it was available with air conditioning and a stereo. Porsche planned to build 3000 examples of the 1994 Speedsters in 1992, but only 936 examples were built and sold during the two years of production.  Once again, the United States was the most important market with 427 Speedsters heading Stateside. Right hand drive versions were exceptionally rare this time: only 14 cars compared to 139 examples in right hand drive of the pre-964 911 Speedster.  In addition, 20 special examples were finished at Porsche Exclusive's workshop at Werk 1 (Factory 1) with the optional \u201cTurbo look\u201d wide-bodies.[8]\nA turbo-bodied cabriolet version was released in 1992. This had the standard electric spoiler and turbo guards.  Mechanically, it was the same as the standard model, apart from 17\" cup wheels and the brakes and suspension, which were 'Turbo' specification. Only 250 of this variant were produced, in total, during the 1992 and 1993 model years.\nThe Porsche 969 was a concept intended to succeed the Porsche 959 and was based on the then upcoming 964 platform. \nThe car was conceived in 1982 as a twin-turbo 911 with four-wheel drive and a PDK gearbox.[9] The project received the in-house code 965 and was developed along with the new, 964 generation of the 911. However, the intended engine (a 3.3 litre, 374\u00a0hp (379\u00a0PS; 279\u00a0kW) flat-six) could not be used due to cooling problems. Various alternatives were considered during the car's development, including a water-cooled version of the traditional flat-six and two variants of Porsche's Indy V8 engine.[9]\nWhile the 969 shared the 911's roofline, its slanted headlights and wide tail were carryovers from the 959.\nUltimately, the project was scrapped. Ongoing engine development issues and a projected price of over 200.000 DM in the wake of a recession kept it from succeeding the 911 turbo. (The 964 turbo made its debut in March 1990.) Fifteen of the 16 prototypes were destroyed in December 1988 and the sole remaining prototype has not been seen since.[9]\n", "Porsche 968": "The Porsche 968 is a sports car made by Porsche AG from 1992 to 1995. It was the final evolution of a line of water-cooled front-engined rear wheel drive models begun almost 20 years earlier with the 924, taking over the entry-level position in the company lineup from the 944 with which it shared about 20% of its parts. The 968 was Porsche's last new front-engined vehicle before the introduction of the Cayenne SUV in 2003.\nPorsche's 944 model debuted for the 1982 model year, was updated as \"944S\" in 1987 and as \"944S2\" in 1989. Shortly after the start of production of the S2 variant, Porsche engineers began working on another set of significant upgrades for the model, as executives were planning a final \"S3\" variant of the 944. During the development phase, 80% of the 944's mechanical components were either significantly modified or completely replaced by the engineers, leaving so little of the outgoing S2 behind that Porsche management chose to introduce the variant as a new model, calling it the 968. In addition to the numerous mechanical upgrades, the new model also received significantly evolved styling both inside and out, with a more modern, streamlined look and more standard luxury than on the 944. Production was moved from the Audi plant in Neckarsulm (where the 924 and 944 had been manufactured under contract to Porsche), to Porsche's own factory in Zuffenhausen.\nLike the 944, the 968 was sold as both a coupe and a convertible. The 968's basic styling was an evolution on that of the outgoing 944, itself based on the earlier 924. In an attempt to create a \"family resemblance\" between models and associate it with the luxury 928 gran turismo, elements were borrowed from its upscale sibling.  Others included a swooping headlamp design inspired by the 959 later incorporated in the Type 993 911. \nThe 968 was powered by an updated version of the 944's straight-four engine, now displacing 3.0\u00a0L with 104\u00a0mm bore, 88\u00a0mm stroke and producing 240\u00a0PS (237\u00a0bhp; 177\u00a0kW). Changes to the 968's powertrain also included the addition of Porsche's then-new VarioCam variable valve timing system, newly optimized induction and exhaust systems, a dual-mass flywheel, and updated engine management electronics among other more minor revisions. The 968's engine was the fourth-largest four-cylinder ever offered in a production car up to that time. A new 6-speed manual transmission replaced the 944's old 5-speed, and Porsche's dual-mode Tiptronic automatic became an available option. Both the VarioCam timing system and Tiptronic transmission were very recent developments for Porsche. The Tiptronic transmission had debuted for the first time only 3 years prior to the debut of the 968, on the 1989 Type 964 911. The VarioCam timing system was first introduced on the 968 and would later become a feature of the Type 993 air-cooled six-cylinder engine.\nMuch of the 968's chassis was carried over from the 944\u00a0S2, which in itself shared many components with the 944 Turbo (internally numbered 951). Borrowed components include the Brembo-sourced four-piston brake calipers on all four wheels, aluminium semi-trailing arms and aluminum front A-arms, used in a Macpherson strut arrangement. The steel unibody structure was also very similar to that of the previous models. Porsche maintained that 80% of the car was new.\nThe 968 also featured numerous small equipment and detail upgrades from the 944, including a Fuba roof-mounted antenna, updated single lens tail lamps, \"Cup\" style 16\" alloy wheels, a wider selection of interior and exterior colors, and a slightly updated \"B\" pillar and rear quarter window to accommodate adhesive installation to replace the older rubber gasket installation.\nFrom 1993 through 1995, Porsche offered a lighter-weight \"Club Sport\" version of the 968 designed for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance. Much of the 968's luxury-oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list; less sound deadening material was used, electrical windows were replaced with crank-driven units, upgraded stereo systems, A/C and sunroof were still optional as on the standard Coupe and Convertible models. In addition, Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats rather than the standard power-operated leather buckets (also manufactured by Recaro), a revised suspension system optimized and lowered by 20\u00a0mm for possible track use, 17-inch wheels (also slightly wider to accommodate wider tires) rather than the 16-inch as found on the Coupe and wider tires, 225 front and 255 rears rather than 205 and 225 respectively. The four-spoke airbag steering wheel was replaced with a thicker-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel with no airbag, heated washer jets were replaced with non heated, vanity covers in the engine bay were deleted, as was the rear wiper. The Club Sport has no rear seats, unlike the 2+2 Coup\u00e9.\nClub Sports were only available in Grand Prix White, black, Speed yellow, Guards red, Riviera blue or Maritime blue. Seat backs were colour-coded to the body. Club Sport decals were standard in either black, red or white but there was a 'delete' option.\nAll Club Sports had black interiors with the 944\u00a0S2 door cards. Due to the reduction in the number of electrical items the wiring loom was reduced in complexity which saved weight and also the battery was replaced with a smaller one, again reducing weight. With the no frills approach meaning less weight, as well as the optimising of the suspension, Porsche could focus media attention on the Club Sport variants fast road and track abilities. This helped to slightly bolster the flagging sales figures in the mid-1990s. The Club Sport variant achieved a 'Performance Car Of The Year' award in 1993 from Performance Car magazine in the UK. Club Sport models were only officially available in the UK, Europe, Japan & Australia, although \"grey market\" cars found their way elsewhere. The declared weight of the 968\u00a0CS is 1320\u00a0kg, ~100\u00a0kg lighter than the regular 968. Acceleration from standstill to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) is 6.3 seconds and top speed is 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).\nA UK-only version called \"968 Sport\", was offered in 1994 and 1995, and was essentially a Club Sport model (and was produced on the same production line with similar chassis numbers) with electric windows, electric release boot, central locking, cloth comfort seats (different from both the standard and the Club Sport). With the added electrics the larger wiring loom was used. The Sport Variant also got back the two rear seats, again in the cloth material specific to the Sport. At \u00a329,975, the 968 Sport was priced \u00a35,500 lower than the standard 968, but had most of the latter's desirable \"luxuries\" and consequently outsold it by a large margin (306 of the 968 Sport models compared to 40 standard 968 coup\u00e9s).[1]\nA 968 CS driven by Peter Fitzgerald and Brett Peters won the 1993 Sandown 6 Hour race in the Australian competition debut of the model.[2]\nIn 1993, Porsche Motorsports at Weissach briefly produced a turbocharged 968 Turbo S, a fairly odd naming choice for Porsche which usually reserves the added \"S\" moniker for models that have been tuned for more power over a \"lesser\" counterpart, such as with the 911 Turbo. The 968 Turbo S shared the same body and interior as the Club Sport and visually can be identified by the NACA bonnet hood scoops, adjustable rear wing and deeper front spoiler. Powered by a large 8 valve SOHC cylinder head (944 Turbo S) with 3.0 Liter 944S2 style engine block. Tests conducted in 1993 produced a 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) of 4.7 seconds and a top speed of 282\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph), performance comparable to the much newer Type 996 911. It generated 305\u00a0bhp (227\u00a0kW) at 5600 rpm with a maximum torque of 500\u00a0N\u22c5m (370\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) at 3000rpm. Only 16 were produced in total and only for sale in mainland Europe.\nBetween 1992 and 1994, Porsche Motorsports Research and Development built and provided a full \"Race\" version (stripped out 968 Turbo S) for Porsche's customer race teams. The 968 Turbo RS was available in two variations; a 337\u00a0bhp (251\u00a0kW) version using the K27 turbocharger from the Turbo S, which was built to the German ADAC GT specification (ballast added to bring the car up to the 1350\u00a0kg minimum weight limit), and an international spec version which used a KKK L41 turbocharger producing 350\u00a0bhp (260\u00a0kW) and was reduced to 1212\u00a0kg in weight.\nOnly 4 were ever produced\u00a0; 1 Guards Red (WPOZZZ96ZNS820065),  1 Speed Yellow (WPOZZZ96ZPS896061), 1 Black (WPOZZZ96ZPS896062) and 1 White (WPOZZZ96ZPS896063). These are the rarest 968s ever produced.\nBetween 1992 and 1996 Fitzgerald Racing Services in Australia sought the assistance of the Porsche motorsports department to build four right hand drive \"Race/Road\" versions using genuine factory RS parts and Australian delivered Porsche 968 CS chassis.  Each car cost in excess of AU$225,000 to build and they were customised to suit the specific requirements of the first owners. Two of these cars were raced extensively, #1 by Peter Fitzgerald and #4 by Graham Lloyd, George Bradbury and Deryck Graham.\nThe 968 was Porsche's last new front-engined vehicle of any type before the introduction of the Cayenne SUV in 2003. Its discontinuation in 1995 coincided with that of the 928, Porsche's only other front-engined car at the time.  The 968 was also the last Porsche sold with a four-cylinder engine prior to the introduction of the 718 Boxster in 2016.\nWhile lacking the wider ranging appeal of the 911, the 968 has nonetheless carved out its own niche in the hearts of enthusiasts.[4] This is likely due to the 968's unique combination of speed and practicality, and low production numbers.[4] Clean, low mileage examples have become extremely scarce and expensive by 2013. In April 2012, when the Gooding & Company bidding ended and the auctioneer's hammer finally fell, the only 1 Red 968 Turbo RS 350\u00a0hp machine had fetched a hefty $346,000 price.[citation needed]\n", "Porsche 991": "1,435\u00a0kg (3,164\u00a0lb) (Carrera)\n1,495\u00a0kg (3,296\u00a0lb) (Carrera S)\n1,554\u00a0kg (3,426\u00a0lb) (Carrera S Cabriolet)\n1,539\u00a0kg (3,393\u00a0lb) (Carrera 4S) \n1,646\u00a0kg (3,629\u00a0lb) (Targa 4S)\n1,605\u00a0kg (3,538\u00a0lb) (Turbo)\n1,627\u00a0kg (3,587\u00a0lb) (Turbo S)\n1,696\u00a0kg (3,739\u00a0lb) (Turbo S Cabriolet)\n1,485\u00a0kg (3,274\u00a0lb) (GTS)\nThe Porsche 991 is the internal designation for the seventh generation Porsche 911 sports car, which was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show on 15 September as the replacement for the 997. The 991 is an entirely new platform, only the third since the original 911 launched in 1963 (the 996 of 1999 was the second new platform). The design has taken an evolutionary step, in keeping with the previous generation 997 and 996. The designer of the 991 is Porsche's Chief Designer Michael Mauer.\nAs usual for the Porsche 911, the 991 generation is an evolutionary design step. Two basic principles were strictly respected: the roof line is less arched, and tapers down into the rear; and the front wings are higher than the lid.\nCompared to the 997, the 991 is slightly larger, with the wheelbase increased by 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) to 2,450\u00a0mm (96.5\u00a0in), and the overall length up by 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) to 4,490\u00a0mm (176.8\u00a0in).[1]  A new transaxle was developed so that the rear wheels could be moved 76\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in) backward in relation to the position of the engine, which significantly improves the weight distribution and cornering performance of the car.[2][3]\nDue to the use of high-strength steel, aluminium and some composites, the weight was reduced to 1,380\u00a0kg (3,042\u00a0lb) for the manual Carrera, rising to 1,605\u00a0kg (3,538\u00a0lb) for the all wheel drive Turbo model with PDK transmission (Porsche Doppelkupplung). PDK is available as an option for all 911 Carrera models as a 7-speed transmission, featuring manual and automatic modes. Gears 1 to 6 have a sports ratio and top speed is reached in 6th gear. 7th gear has a long ratio and helps to reduce fuel consumption by keeping engine revs low. The PDK is essentially two gearboxes merged into a single unit and thus requires two clutches. For all 991 models, the PDK is produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. The auto start/stop function is standard on all variants of the 911 Carrera.\nPorsche 911 Carrera 4S Coup\u00e9\nPorsche 911 Carrera 4S Coup\u00e9\nPorsche 911 Targa 4\nIntroduced at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, the Carrera is equipped with a 3.4 litre boxer engine with direct fuel injection, 350\u00a0PS (257\u00a0kW; 345\u00a0bhp) at 7,400 rpm and 390\u00a0N\u22c5m (288\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 5,600 rpm. The Carrera S has a 3.8 litre engine with 400\u00a0PS (294\u00a0kW; 395\u00a0bhp) at 7,400 rpm and 440\u00a0N\u22c5m (325\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 5,600 rpm.\nThe convertible variant of the 991 was announced in both Carrera and Carrera S versions at the LA Motor Show in November 2011.[4]\nIn September 2012 at the Paris Motor Show, the all-wheel-drive variants \u2013 the Carrera 4 and 4S, were added to the 991 line-up.\nIntroduced in November 2014 at the LA Motor Show, the 991 Carrera GTS sits between the Carrera S and GT3.  Base options included with purchase: 430\u00a0PS (316\u00a0kW; 424\u00a0bhp) PowerKit, Sport Chrono Package, Sport Exhaust System, Dynamic Engine Mounts, 10mm lowered suspension, Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTM) system, LED daytime running lights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS), Sport Design Front Spoiler, Sport Design Side Mirrors, GTS badging, and 20\" Centerlock wheels. When optioned with PDK, 0\u201360\u00a0mph is achieved consistently at 3.8 seconds with the help of Launch Control.\nAt the Detroit Motor Show in January 2014, Porsche introduced the Targa 4 and Targa 4S models. These new derivatives come equipped with an all-new roof technology with the original targa design, now with an all-electric cabriolet roof along with the B-pillar and the glass 'dome' at the rear.\nOn January 12, 2015, Porsche announced the 911 Targa GTS at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Similar in appearance to the existing Targa 4 and 4S models, the GTS added the 430\u00a0PS (316\u00a0kW; 424\u00a0bhp) engine plus several otherwise optional features.[5]\nWith the introduction at the Geneva Motor Show, in March 2013, of the latest GT3 model came the announcement of active rear steering. It is claimed by Porsche to provide higher lateral dynamics than previously available.  Car speed inputs determine whether the rears steer in the same or opposite direction of the front wheels. It is the first GT3 offered only with automatic transmission.\nAt the start of 2014, deliveries of the GT3 were halted following two fires.[6]  A subsequent recall to replace the engines of all 785 cars was announced in March 2014 before manufacturing of the GT3 would restart.[7]\nPorsche launched the RS version of the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.[8] Compared to the 991 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include 911 Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket).\nThe 3.8-litre unit found in the 991 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit with 500 horsepower and 339\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (460\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The drivetrain delivers 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 3.3 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0\u2013200\u00a0km/h (0\u2013124\u00a0mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013 and Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 991 GT3, there is rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock.\nRevealed at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show on March 1, the 911 R shares most of its underpinnings with the GT3 RS, but removes the roll cage, rear wing, and associated bodywork for a weight savings of 50\u00a0kg.  The R comes only with a 6-speed manual transmission, and has a top speed of 323\u00a0km/h (201\u00a0mph) due to a lower drag coefficient compared to the GT3 RS.  It also offers additional options for a lighter flywheel and removal of the air conditioning and audio systems.  Production will be limited to 991 examples, as a 2016 model.[9]\n911 Turbo\nPorsche 911 Turbo S\nIntroduced in May 2013, the 991 Turbo has a twin-turbocharged 3.8 litre engine generating 520\u00a0PS (382\u00a0kW; 513\u00a0bhp) and 620\u00a0N\u22c5m (457\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque.[10] The S version has 560\u00a0PS (412\u00a0kW; 552\u00a0bhp) and 700\u00a0N\u22c5m (516\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque, but the torque is pushed to 750\u00a0N\u22c5m (553\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) with overboost.  Both vehicles have all-wheel drive and a seven-speed dual clutch sequential transmission.  The Turbo S can reach 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 3.1 seconds as claimed by Porsche but has achieved 2.6 seconds by many car magazine tests.[11][12] New technologies featuring adaptive aerodynamics and rear wheel steer are new on these cars.\nTurbo Cabriolet and Turbo S Cabriolet versions were added to the range at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[13]\n(SC) = Sport Chrono\n(PK) = Powerkit\nFollowing an introduction at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, the 991 was revised for the 2017 model year. The updated Porsche 911 (at Porsche internally referred to as 991.2 or 991 II) introduced new styling and options, along with all new, smaller 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged flat-six engines across the range.\nThis was the first time standard Carrera models had adopted turbocharged engines rather than naturally aspirated ones, which was initially criticised for lacking engine noise that previous non-turbo variations had. This criticism quickly dissipated as it became apparent the 991.2 offered a substantial step up in performance and feel over the preceding model.[citation needed]\nPorsche 991 Carrera\n2015 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S Coupe\n2015 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S Coupe\nInitially from December 2015 available models were the coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions of Carrera and Carrera S. The all-wheel drive versions Carrera 4 and 4S were revealed in October 2015.\nIn October 2017 Porsche announced the 911 Carrera T (Touring), offering the base Carrera drivetrain but with shorter rear axle ratio, mechanical differential lock, PASM Sport lowered suspension, Sport Chrono package and sports exhaust as standard. It includes reduced sound insulation, light-weight glass side/rear windows, Sport-Tex seats, a shortened shift lever, removed rear seats and communication system (with no-cost option to add them back), Carrera S wheels, as well as optional rear-wheel steering, PDK and bucket seats.[14]\nThe Targa 4 and Targa 4S were revealed in October 2015.\nPorsche 911 Targa 4 GTS\nPorsche 911 Targa 4 GTS\nIn January 2017 five new GTS versions (RWD coup\u00e9 and cabriolet as well as AWD coup\u00e9, cabriolet and Targa) were launched.[15]\nAt the March 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the facelifted GT3 was revealed, sporting a larger 4.0-litre flat-six engine, aerodynamic upgrades, a revised look and an optional 6-speed manual gearbox, something which was absent on the 991.1-phase GT3.\nFollowing in September 2017 Porsche announced the 911 GT3 with Touring Package at the International Motor Show (IAA), a 911 GT3 available exclusively with manual transmission and without a fixed rear wing.[16]\nPorsche 991 GT3 RS and 991 Carrera T at NYIAS 2018\nPorsche 911 GT3 RS\nIn February 2018, Porsche revealed the new GT3 RS, available with optional Weissach package.[17]\nThe 911 GT2 RS was officially launched by Porsche at the 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed along with the introduction of the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. It is powered by a 3.8\u00a0L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine that produces a maximum power of 700\u00a0PS (515\u00a0kW; 690\u00a0hp) at 7,000 rpm and 750\u00a0N\u22c5m (550\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque, giving the car a power to weight ratio of 2.1\u00a0kg (4.63\u00a0lb) per horsepower and making it the most powerful 911 ever built. A Weissach package option is available.[18]\nIn late September 2017, the GT2 RS made a 6:47.3 lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring, making it the fastest production car lap time recorded on the track to date.[19]\nPorsche 911 Turbo S convertible\nPorsche 911 Turbo S at 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed\nPorsche 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series\nIn December 2015, Turbo and Turbo S versions were launched.\nIn June 2017 the Turbo S Exclusive Series with powerkit and CFRP body panels was launched, limited to 500 units. Braided carbon-fibre wheels are available as option.[20][21]\n[22]\nThe Porsche 991 was titled World Performance Car 2012 shortly after famed Porsche designer Ferdinand Alexander Porsche died.[23][24] The GT3 was awarded the title of World Performance Car Of The Year in 2014.[25][26]\n", "Porsche 993": "The Porsche 993 is the internal designation for the version of the Porsche 911 model manufactured and sold between January 1994 and early 1998 (model years 1995-1998 in the United States), replacing the 964. Its discontinuation marked the end of air-cooled Porsches, with the 993 being the last air-cooled 911.  The 993 generation of the 911 is often referred to as the best and most desirable of the 911 series, not only because of its beauty, but also because of its great performance, even by modern standards. The 993 is quoted as \"the last complete 'modern classic'\"; \"the 993 was and forever will be that last fresh breath of air that Porsche gave the world; elegance and muscle all in one package.\"[3] The book \"Porsche 993 - Essential Companion\" refers to the 993 as the \"King of Porsche,\" and it is generally acknowledged as \"The purists' Holy Grail.\"[4]\nIn its April 12, 2017 article entitled \"The Porsche 993 Actually Lives up to the Hype,\" Road & Track writes that the 993 is \"something truly special,\" with \"a combination of old-school feel and modern usability that isn't found in many other cars,\" with \"great steering, great brakes, and a wonderfully composed package.\" It also states that \"The 993 is also beautifully built -- it's a relic from the time when Porsche didn't cut corners anywhere.\"[5]\nThe 993 was much improved over, and quite different from its predecessor.  According to Porsche, every part of the car was designed from the ground up, including the engine[6] and only 20% of its parts were carried over from the previous generation.[7] Porsche refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"[8] Porsche's engineers devised a new light-alloy subframe with coil and wishbone suspension (an all new multi-link system), putting behind the previous lift-off oversteer[6] and making significant progress with the engine and handling, creating a more civilized car with better than ever quality with an unmatched driving experience.[7] The 993 was also the first 911 to receive a six speed gearbox.[9]\nLike previous and future generations of the Porsche 911, there were several variants of the car manufactured, varying in body style, engines, drivetrains and included equipment. Whereas the Porsche 964 produced 247 horsepower,[10] the 1995 993 produced 272, and this was increased again in the model year 1996-1998 911s with the addition of the Varioram system, which added additional power, particularly in the mid-ranges, and also resulted in a more throttle noise at higher revs; as a consequence, the 1996-1998 Varioram 993s put out 285 horsepower.[11]  This resulted in a 15% increase in horsepower over its 964 predecessor.\nThe 993 was replaced by the Porsche 996. This represented a dramatic change for Porsche. As many enthusiasts agree, \"the 993 is one of the sweetest spots in the 911's half-century of existence,\" and while \"more modern versions might be more dynamically capable, they're bloated behemoths in comparison to the lean 993.\"[12]\nThe external design of the Porsche 993, penned by Englishman Tony Hatter, retained the basic body shell architecture of the 964 and other earlier 911 models, but with revised external panels, with much more flared wheel arches, a smoother front and rear bumper design, an enlarged retractable rear wing and teardrop mirrors.\nThis car was promoted globally via its role of safety car during the 1994 Formula One season.\nA major change was the implementation of all alloy multi-link rear suspension attached to an alloy sub frame, a completely new design derived from the project 989, a four-door sedan which never went into production. The system later continued in the 993's successor, type 996, and required the widening of the rear wheel arches, which gave better stability. The new suspension improved handling, making it more direct, more stable, and helping to reduce tendency to oversteer if the throttle was lifted during hard cornering, a trait of earlier 911s. It also reduced interior noise and improved ride quality.\nThe 993 was the first generation of 911 to have a standard six-speed manual transmission; previous cars, except for the Porsche 959, had 4- or 5-speed gearboxes. In virtually every situation, it was possible to keep the engine in its best torque range above 4500 rpm. The Carrera / Carrera S / Cabriolet and Targa models (rear wheel drive) were available with a \"Tiptronic\" 4-speed automatic transmission, first introduced in the 964. Beginning with model year 1995, Porsche offered the Tiptronic S with additional steering wheel mounted controls and refined software for smoother, quicker shifts. Since the 993's introduction, the Tiptronic is capable of recognizing climbs and descents.  The Tiptronic cars suffer compared with the six speed in both acceleration and also top speed, but the differences are slight.[13] Tiptronic cars also suffered a 55-pound weight penalty.[14]\nFurther, the 993's optional all wheel drive system was refined over that of the 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 supercar, replacing the centre differential with a viscous coupling unit. In conjunction with the 993's redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by all wheel drive without having to suffer as many compromises as the past all wheel drive system. Its simpler layout also reduced the earlier all wheel drive system's weight, though the four wheel drive C4 weighs 111 pounds (50\u00a0kg) more than the rear wheel drive version (at 3,131 pounds vs. 3,020 pounds or 1,420\u00a0kg vs. 1,370\u00a0kg).[15]\nOther improvements include a new dual-flow exhaust, larger brakes with drilled discs, and revised power steering.\nThe Carrera was available in rear and all-wheel drive versions. It was equipped with the naturally aspirated 3.6 liter M64 engine, further developed from the 964, and combined with a new dual-flow exhaust system now incorporating two catalytic converters. The 993 Carrera originally was equipped with orange turn indicators on the front, side and rear, black brake calipers, black Carrera logo on the back and 16 inch alloy wheels with black Porsche logos on the center wheelcaps. The 1994 coup\u00e9 version had a curb weight of 1370\u00a0kg (basic empty weight 1270\u00a0kg). This model came with a ground clearance at curb weight of 110\u00a0mm, except for the US version which had a ground clearance of 120\u00a0mm. This was further lowered with the M030 sport chassis option to 90\u00a0mm. The coup\u00e9 is the stiffest, tightest, most solid, yet lightest of the 993 models.[16]\nThe Cabriolet, introduced simultaneously alongside the coup\u00e9 in April 1994 for the 1995 model year, featured a fully electrical and hand-stitched soft-top reinforced with metal sheets and an automatic wind-blocker. On the rear of the Cabriolet a small spoiler was mounted with the 3rd braking light. The 993 Cabriolet was slightly heavier than the coup\u00e9 version and has a curb weight of 1420\u00a0kg. On average a high percentage of the total Cabriolets produced ended up in the US. Both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions were available with all-wheel drive.\nPorsche offered the 993 Carrera also as an all-wheel drive version called the Carrera 4. In contrast with the Type 964, Porsche deleted the \"2\" from the rear-wheel drive \"Carrera\" name tag. However among enthusiasts, to differentiate between the rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants of the Type 993 Carrera they were (and still are) commonly referred to as \"C2\" and \"C4\", respectively, as purists will accept nothing other than 2 wheel rear drive.[17] The Carrera 4 has an ABD system (Automatic Braking Differential); it brakes the inner wheel when accelerating out of a corner. From the outside the Carrera 4 is visually distinguishable by clear front & side turn indicators and rear red turn indicators. The brake calipers are painted silver as is the 'Carrera 4' badge on the hood. The center wheel-caps carry the Carrera 4 logo instead of the Porsche crest. The Carrera 4 has a curb weight of 1420\u00a0kg, same as the Cabriolet, and in both instances more than the coupe. Key on the Carrera 4 is the weight saving versus the 964 all wheel drive system, a lower maintenance viscous coupling unit that transfers 5-50% of power to the front wheels and changes the driving behavior of the car compared to the 993 Carrera. The 993 Carrera 4 all-wheel drive is suited to cope with all inclement weather conditions, which provides extra security in rain or snow, though on a dry circuit the C2 is the faster car, and the C4 is of course heavier than the C2.[17] As one publication summarized it, \"Some may like the all-wheel-drive system making the front end feel a tad more stable.  Others will insist that a skittish nose and lively, ultra-informative steering are absolute necessities for proper Porsche driving.  On a dry track and everything else being equal, the rear-drive car is probably the faster of the two.\"[18]  There was no Triptronic option available on the Carrera 4.\nThe options list for the 993 Carrera (and most other variants) offered many choices, including up to five different styles of wheels, various suspension set-ups, and three different seat styles (comfort, sport, racing). In addition, many upholstery options were offered and various sound systems including digital sound processing. Further, customers had the option of any color other than standard shades. Even more, the Tequipment- and Exclusive-Programs added further options and built to order almost any specific wishes of customers such as special consoles, fax-machines or even brightly colored interior upholstery.\nIn contrast with most of the other variants, production of the Carrera coup\u00e9 and Cabriolet ceased with the end of model year 1997, except for a very few produced in a shortened 1998 model year.\nThe Targa version of the 993 was introduced in model year 1996 and saw the debut of the so-called \"greenhouse\" system: a retractable glass roof, a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The glass roof would retract underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new glass roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and finish without the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa has the body of the convertible with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof.\nThe Targa was equipped with distinctive 2-piece 17-inch (430\u00a0mm) wheels, which could be ordered as an option on all cars not having standard 18-inch (460\u00a0mm) wheels. Problems with the Targa include heat in the cabin, creaking noises on rough roads and a very complicated and unreliable mechanism.  In addition, the Targa roof is heavier than the coupe version, and that extra weight is at the top of the car, raising its center of gravity and decreasing handling.[19]\nTarga Production Numbers:\n1996: 2442 (US+Canada: 462)\n1997: 1843 (US+Canada: 567)\n1998:  334 (US+Canada: 122)\nTotal Production Run: 4619\nThe 993 Turbo coup\u00e9 was released in 1995. It featured a new turbocharged engine displacing 3.6\u00a0liters and producing 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW; 402\u00a0hp). Twin turbochargers and air-to-air intercoolers, electronic engine management, redesigned cylinder heads and other modified engine internals were used. The 993 Turbo was the first 911 Turbo with all wheel drive, finally delivering Porsche 959 performance as a production car. The electronic engine management helped the Turbo to achieve fuel efficiency far superior to any of the previous production Turbos[citation needed]. In connection with two catalytic converters and an on-board-diagnostics-system including four oxygen-sensors, it also made the 993 Turbo the cleanest sports car at its time[citation needed]. The Turbo's bodywork differs from the Carrera body by widened rear wheel arches (approximately 6\u00a0cm), redesigned front and rear bumper moldings, and a fixed rear wing housing the intercoolers. New 18-inch (460\u00a0mm) alloy wheels with weight-reducing hollow spokes were standard.\nThis was one of the first production cars in the world to have OBDII diagnostics[citation needed] (the 3.8-liter and track versions didn't have it, and the normally aspirated 993s didn't get it until 1996). All turbos since have had water-cooled heads. The car also had brakes that were larger than those on the base Carrera model.\nWithin the 1996 through 1998 production run, there were two distinct differences: the 1996 and the later ones. The 1997s and 1998s had the following differences from the 1996s:\n\nNeed For Speed: High Stakes uses the Porsche 993 Turbo as the flagship car of the game.\nDuring the second to the last year of production of the 993 (1997), Porsche offered the 993 Turbo S. Ultimately 183 cars were sold. The Turbo S is a high-spec Turbo including a power upgrade to 450 hp (DIN) (424 hp (SAE) for the American market). The inclusion of extras including carbonfibre decoration in the interior makes it different from the earlier lightweight, spartan 964 Turbo S. The 993 Turbo S is recognized by yellow brake calipers, a slightly larger rear wing, a 4-pipe exhaust and air scoops behind the doors.  This was the last of the air-cooled Turbos. 12 Turbo S cars were delivered to Australia.\nThe Carrera 4 S (1996) and later rear wheel drive Carrera S (1997) shared the Turbo model's bodyshell, but housed the naturally aspirated Carrera engine in the rear. The 4S came with four-wheel drive, whereas the S (sometimes referred to as C2S) was rear wheel drive. Both S models had slightly lowered suspension compared to standard Carrera models. The all wheel drive 4S is heavier than the C2S due to the former's all wheel drive mechanicals, resulting in a curb weight of 3,197 pounds for the C4S vs. 3,064 pounds for the C2S.[20]  This also results in both a quicker 0-60 time as well as a higher top speed for the C2S as compared with the C4S.[21]  Although a Carrera S Cabriolet was never officially offered by the factory, a small number (believed to be 5) were special ordered through the Porsche Exclusive department in 1997 and sold as 1998 models by Beverly Hills Porsche in California and only 1 was ordered by a VIP client through Porsche Exclusive department for the European market [22]. The wide body is widely acclaimed for its rear looks. It creates more aerodynamic drag, leading to slightly lower top speeds compared to the narrower siblings (about 5\u00a0km/h), but the wider tires result in excellent roadholding for the widebody 993 model.[23]  As opposed to later models, the 993 Cabriolet was never produced as a S version. The widebodies, and in particular the C2S, are the most valuable and achieve the highest sales prices.[17]  In addition, the widebodies are quite rare, with just 1,752 C2S examples made for all of North America during the entire 993 series run (in part because they were manufactured only for the 1997 model year, together with a very brief stub period later in 1997 denominated as 1998 models),[24] though of course special extremely limited run models such as the 993RS, GT2, and Turbo S are rarer and more costly still.\nThe Carrera RS is a lightweight variant of the Carrera. It features a naturally aspirated 3.8 liter engine with 300 hp (DIN). On the outside it is easily distinguishable by a special non-retractable rear wing, small front flaps and 3-piece 18-inch (460\u00a0mm) aluminum wheels. The headlight washers were deleted for weight saving reasons. Inside the rear seats were removed, and special racing seats and spartan door cards were installed. Sound proofing was also reduced to a minimum.\nThere are further RS variants, in particular a track-oriented Carrera RS Clubsport (also referred to as the RSR or RSCS in some countries) with relatively limited road usability. The Clubsport came equipped with a welded roll cage and certain comfort features such as carpets, power windows, air conditioning and radio were deleted. Externally it sports a larger rear wing and deeper chin spoiler than the standard RS.\nThe Carrera RS was produced in model years 1995 and 1996. It was street legal in European and many other countries around the world, but was not approved for export to the United States. As with the relatively low production-quantity RS variants of earlier 911 types, some Porsche owners will turn to the standard Carrera and modify it into an RS clone as an enthusiast's attempt to own something that otherwise is unobtainable due to the rarity and consequent high market value of the RS. The practice, often using authentic Porsche-sourced RS parts, is perhaps more common amongst U.S. owners, since the RS/RS Clubsport was never certified for sale there.[citation needed]\nThe GT2 was the racing version of the Turbo. By the mid 1990s most of the sanctioning bodies of road racing had placed severe limitations if not outright bans on the use all-wheel drive systems, due in part to Audi's earlier success in campaigning their various Quattro cars in touring car races around the globe, to Porsche's 959 and its racing version the Porsche 961, and in part to the Nissan Skyline. It was in this atmosphere that in order to take their turbo-engined 993 racing, Porsche created the rear drive GT2. The deletion of the front drivetrain also brought with it the benefit of significant weight savings to the competition car. To qualify the car for racing a limited number of street GT2s were created for homologation purposes, which are now highly prized and valued by Porsche 993 collectors. The interior treatment of the GT2 is similar to that of the sibling Carrera RS. On the exterior, the fenders of the Turbo have been cut back and replaced with bolt-on plastic pieces in order to accommodate large racing tires and to help ease the repairs of damage to the fenders that are an often reoccurring event in auto racing.\nUntil 1997, the street version of GT2 racecar, named GT had almost the same engine as the Turbo, but operated with higher boost pressure and delivering 430 bhp (DIN). In model year 1998 it was raised to 450 bhp (DIN) and a twin ignition was added.\nThe many racing variants have different engine set-ups depending on the applicable racing series. By 1996 the factory-quoted power rating was 465\u00a0bhp at 5,700 rpm and torque of 670 Nm at 5,000 rpm. Power output came as high as 600\u00a0bhp (450\u00a0kW) in an \"Evo\" version designed for the GT1-series, which was ultimately replaced by the mid-engine 911 GT1.\nAdditionally, the rear deck lid of an original GT2 will also sport \"911 GT\" instead of \"911 GT2\".\nThe Speedster model, was a variant of the 993, with a lowered roof, and a redesigned interior.\nIn contrast to the G-model and the 964, Porsche never officially released a 993 Speedster. However, two were built by the factory: a dark green Speedster equipped with Tiptronic S and 17-inch (430\u00a0mm) wheels for Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (for his 60th anniversary) in 1995 and another wide-body, silver Speedster with manual transmission and 18-inch (460\u00a0mm) wheels for American TV star Jerry Seinfeld in 1998.  The Seinfeld speedster was originally delivered as either a cabriolet or targa model and later sent back to the factory \"Exclusive\" department to be \"rebuilt\" as a speedster.\nAfter the 3.3 liter G-model Turbo convertible (1987\u201389), Porsche never officially offered an air-cooled Turbo convertible again. However, in 1995 a small number (believed to be 14[25]) 993 Turbo Cabriolets were sold before the introduction of the 993 Turbo coup\u00e9. They featured the 360 hp (DIN) single-turbo engine of the 964 Turbo 3.6, a 5-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel drive and the wing of the 964 Turbo 3.6. This cost a premium of DM 89,500 (or plus 62%) over the standard 993 Cabriolet's price.\nThere were a few engine options available for the 993.\nNaturally aspirated\nThe 993 Carrera is powered by an air-cooled Porsche flat-six \"boxer\" engine using a Single Overhead Cam (SOHC) valvetrain. Porsche had begun employing the earliest evolution of this overhead cam engine in the 1963 Porsche 901, which had a displacement of 2 liters and produced 130 hp (DIN).\nMore specifically, the 993 engine is the final factory refinement of the Porsche-designated \"M64\" boxer engine. The standard, naturally aspirated M64/05(06) engine at 3.6 liters capacity is a refined version of the M64/01 installed in the 964 Carrera. The M64/05(06) made 272\u00a0PS (200\u00a0kW; 268\u00a0hp) through model year 1995.\nIn 1995 Porsche switched to the VarioRam -equipped M64/21(22) engine. Varioram adjusts the length of the air intake ducts in line with the engine RPMs and the speed of the car, with this the power output is increased to 286\u00a0PS (210\u00a0kW; 282\u00a0hp).\nFor the 993 Carrera RS there was a slightly more powerful version with 3.8 liter 300\u00a0hp (221\u00a0kW) available and this was also offered as build-to-order options throughout the 993's lifespan.\nTurbocharged\nThe 3.6 liter twin turbo M64/60 engine uses two KKK K16 turbos and produces 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW; 402\u00a0hp).\nMore powerful versions (430 and 450 hp (DIN)) were available as build-to-order options, in the Turbo S, and in the GT2.\nDepending on the country, Porsche still offers 430 and 450\u00a0PS (331\u00a0kW; 444\u00a0hp) kits for the Turbo.\n", "Porsche 996": "The Porsche 996 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 model manufactured with first model year 1998 and last 2004. [1]It was replaced by the Type 997 in model year 2005.\nThe 996 had little in common with its predecessor, with the first new chassis platform since the original 911 and a new water-cooled engine. Technically, it was a major change, a complete breakaway from the original car other than overall layout.\nDevelopment was shared with its smaller brother, the roadster-only Boxster which appeared around the same time, including the front suspension, much of the interior, and the engine, all of which were enlarged for the 996. However the multi-link rear suspension, derived from the preceding 993, was different.\nAt its debut, the 996 featured the most significant change from the classic 911 series: a water-cooled engine replacing the previously air-cooled engine. Progressively stringent emissions and noise regulations, environmental concerns, a higher expectation for refinement and a high-performance 4 valve per cylinder engine made the switch necessary. Other major changes include a completely new platform having a sleeker body with a more raked windshield, and re-designed interior.\nThe Porsche 996 was a new design by Pinky Lai; the first new 911 that was completely redesigned, and carried over little from its predecessor. All new body work, interior, and the first water-cooled engine in a 911. The 996 replaced the 993 from which only the front suspension, rear multi-link suspension, and 6 speed gearbox were retained in revised form.\nThe first 996s were available as a coup\u00e9 or cabriolet (Convertible) initially with rear wheel, or later, with four-wheel drive, and a 3.4 litre flat-6 naturally aspirated engine producing 296 bhp (224\u00a0kW).  The cars had the same front end as the Boxster and Carrera owners complained long and loud about the \"lower priced car that looked just like theirs did\", hence the headlight change for the Carrera in 2002. The design for these headlamps could be traced back to the Porsche Panamericana concept car.\nIn 2000, Porsche introduced the 996 Turbo, equipped with four-wheel-drive and a 3.6 litre, twin turbocharged and intercooled flat-six producing 420\u00a0bhp (309\u00a0kW), making the car capable of 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.2 seconds.  An X50 option which included larger turbochargers and intercoolers along with revised engine control software became available from the factory in 2002, increasing power to 450\u00a0hp (336\u00a0kW).  (Porsche produced a Turbo S in 2005, which also had the X50 option with 450\u00a0bhp, with the formerly optional Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite ceramic brakes (PCCB) as standard.)\nIn 2001, horsepower on the base Carrera model was increased by 4\u00a0bhp to 300\u00a0bhp. 2001 also marked the final year of production for the base Carrera 4 Coupe in narrow body format. \nIn 2002, the standard models underwent minor re-styling, which included switching to the Turbo-style headlamps and to a new front fascia.  These were sometimes known as the Mk2 generation of the 996, or the 996.2.  In addition, engine capacity was also increased to 3.6 litres across the range, yielding gains of 15 horsepower for the naturally aspirated models.  2002 also marked the start of the production of the 996 based Targa, with a sliding glass \"green house\" roof system like its Type 993 predecessor.  Also in 2002, Carrera 4S model was first introduced. The C4S as it is commonly called, shares the wide-body look of the Turbo as well as the brakes and suspension.[2]\nThe 996 Turbo debuted at the Frankfurt Auto show in September 1999. It went on sale in the US in summer of 2000 as a 2001 model. The turbo is powered by a water-cooled twin turbocharged/intercooled 3.6L H-6 derived from the 1998 LeMans winning GT-1 car. The engine produces 415\u00a0hp at 6,000 rpm and 415\u00a0lb\u00b7ft (563\u00a0N\u00b7m) of torque. It features all-wheel drive and was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed Tiptronic transmission. It has revised styling and a wider stance than the naturally aspirated 996 Carreras, along with new bi-xenon headlamps. It also came with VarioCam Plus and stability management, and in the US, a rear spoiler would automatically rise at 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) and lower at 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h). The bodywork was also revised to allow airflow to 3 radiators up front and to accommodate 18-inch wheels and tires.\nIn 2002, the turbo offered an X50 option package that included larger turbochargers (K24 turbos) and intercoolers, a revised ECU and exhaust which raised output to 450\u00a0hp.  Other features introduced in 2002, was a glove box, center mounted cup-holders, an optional Bose stereo and rain-sensing wipers.\nIn 2003, Porsche North America restated their horsepower numbers due to SAE changes. The turbo was still listed at 415\u00a0hp however the X50 option was now listed at 444\u00a0hp.\nIn 2004, the Turbo cabriolet debuted which was the first 911 Turbo Cabriolet since 1989.[3]\nIn 2005, Porsche debuted the Turbo S model available as either a coup\u00e9 or a cabriolet. The Turbo S was essentially a 996 turbo with the X50 option but also included PCCB, 6-disc CD changer and aluminum-faced instruments.[4]\nThe 996 platform was used as the basis for two lightweight GT variants called GT2[5] and GT3. The GT3 was based on the standard 996 Carrera, but was stripped of a great deal of equipment for weight savings, featured stiffer, adjustable suspension and upgraded brakes, and used the bodyshell of the four-wheel-drive version, which incorporated additional front-end stiffening. It was produced in two versions. The first, commonly referred to as the Mk.I GT3, was released in 1999 in all markets, save North America. It featured a naturally aspirated version 3.6L flat six making 360\u00a0bhp (270\u00a0kW). This engine was shared with the 996 Turbo and was a derivative of the Le Mans winning engine developed for the 911 GT1. The Mk.II GT3 variant was based on the second generation of the 996, and featured updated aerodynamics, and a more powerful version of the 3.6L engine from the MK.I, now producing 380\u00a0bhp (280\u00a0kW). The Mk.II was the first GT3 marketed in the North America. In a 2004 testing of the Mk.II GT3, the car accelerated 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.0 seconds, and produced 1.03\u00a0g on the skidpad, the second highest number ever recorded by a street legal automobile.\nThe counterpart to the GT3, the GT2, was RWD as well, to save weight and to avoid power losses through the transmission.[6] (This is primarily due to the fact that it was built to compete in GT2 class racing, which mandated RWD). It received an added group of aerodynamic body parts, and a re-tuned version of the 996 Turbo's 3.6 litre, twin turbocharged engine featuring larger turbochargers and intercoolers, revised intake and exhaust systems, and re-programmed engine control software. The result was 489\u00a0hp (365\u00a0kW) and 484\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (656\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque respectively, enough to launch the car from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.9 seconds and to a top speed of 198\u00a0mph (319\u00a0km/h). Bigger wheels and tires along with lightweight ceramic brakes were standard.[6] The GT2's fixed rear wing (made of CFRP for the post-2003 cars) appears to be a concession to racing rules that usually outlaw moving aerodynamic devices.[6] It had no rear seat and no air conditioning.[6] Both cars were available only with six-speed manual transmissions.\nThe Turbo, GT2 and GT3 models use the Aluminum crankcase of the air-cooled 911 with its true dry sump oiling system. The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine are covered with two separately installed water jackets each covering a bank of 3 cylinders on each side of the engine, thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air-cooled cylinders (the normal 996 Carrera engine has the cylinders and water jackets cast together with the crankcase). This engine is very similar to that of the Le Mans winning Dauer Porsche 962 and Porsche GT1 racing cars' engines.\nThe 99 Model year featured a 3.4L engine producing 296\u00a0bhp. The 2000 and 2001 model years received a slight increase in horsepower to 300\u00a0bhp while retaining the same figures for torque produced. In addition, Porsche made many changes to the 3.4-liter unit over its production lifespan, so the last of these 3.4L engines (made in 2001) have improved reliability.[7]\nThe 2002+ cars received a 3.6L engine which provided an extra 15\u00a0bhp (11\u00a0kW) of power (taking output to 315\u00a0bhp or 320\u00a0PS) and an additional 15\u00a0lb\u00b7ft (20\u00a0N\u00b7m) of torque (increasing from 258 to 273\u00a0lb\u00b7ft). The inclusion of Variocam Plus (as opposed to Variocam on the earlier 996) improved power delivery through the rpm range. The headlights on the 996 Carrera also adopted the bi-xenon headlights of the MK1 turbo iteration. Seat belt pretensioners were added. In 2000, the Tiptronic transmission was modified to allow it to enter manual mode by clicking buttons on the steering wheel.\nUpdates also included a revised front bumper to decrease front end lift, and the addition of a glove box. The second generation 996 gained 25\u00a0kg (55\u00a0lb) in the facelift.\nPorsche offered a special edition of the 996 for the year 2000. The company introduced the car as \"The 911 for the Millennium\" and based it on the Carrera 4 coup\u00e9. Only 911 were made. It featured all of the options that came with the turbo with electric and heated seats and telephone module. It came with polished turbo twist wheels and GT3 skirting with some having the same aero as the GT3\nThis special edition was finished in Violet Chromaflair paint with natural leather interior and dark burr maple trim. Available with a Tiptronic or six-speed manual gearbox, the car was well equipped. A number plate on the center console and a unique \"911\" badge on the engine lid and lettering on the door sills make this special edition easy to identify.\nPorsche celebrated the 911's 40-year history in 2003, using the slogan, \"40 Jahre 911/40 Fast Years\". The company also introduced the 996 \"40th Anniversary Edition\" for model year 2004. This model has the 996 Turbo's front-end, and was available only in Carrera GT Silver exterior paint. Other unique features included: X51 power kit, turbo radiators, limited slip differential, sport suspension, polished 5-spoke alloys (unique to this model), GT3 side skirts, natural gray leather interior (with luggage set to match), sports seats (there was a power comfort seat option), polished exhaust tips, heated seats (option in Latin America), litronic bi-xenon headlights, special dynamic sealed panels, and a special \"40 Jahre 911\" logo on the back. The power was increased from 320 to 345hp (254kW).  Only 1,963 units were made, to commemorate 1963\u2014the year the 911 was introduced.\nProduction Numbers:[9]\nHollywood custom car builder Eddie Paul created a modified 996 Carrera as one of a set of three vehicles for Pixar's 2006 Cars promotional tour.[10] Sally, a blue Porsche 996 designed to closely resemble a 2002 Carrera, is built on a slightly-shortened wheelbase; her windscreen is tilted closer to vertical (adding a few inches to the car's height) to accommodate the animated character's eyes.[11]\nIn 2007, a motorist's 2001 Porsche 911 was searched during a traffic stop by Hoover, Alabama police. The police department seized the vehicle after they found 10 kilograms of cocaine hidden inside two compartments. Since then the vehicle was redecorated in two-tone police blue with a wing, light bar, and rear window lights.[12] The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 as a Hoover Police Department police car and has appeared at various public events.[13]\n", "Porsche Intermediate Shaft Bearing issue": "Most models of the 996 generation of the Porsche 911 sports car were afflicted with a vulnerability in the intermediate shaft (IMS) that drove their engines' camshafts. Failure of the intermediate shaft's roller bearing of the IMS could destroy the engine entirely.The M96/M97 engines in the Porsche 996 used an intermediate shaft (IMS) to transmit power from the crankshaft to the camshafts. One end of the IMS is held in place by a plain bearing, the other by a roller bearing, with the roller bearing at the front of the engine, behind the transmission. Three types of roller bearing were used over the engine's life: dual-row roller until 1999 and in some 2000 and 2001 cars. Starting in model year 2000, Porsche began phasing out the dual row bearing and went to a smaller single row roller bearing, with significantly less load capacity.[1] From MY 2006 the IMS bearing remained single row but was of a different design that could not be replaced.Failure of the IMS bearing led to failure of the timing gear and potentially loss of the engine. Failure rates of 4-10% were cited in the US Class Action lawsuit (see below).The IMS bearing is a sealed unit. It is submerged in engine oil when the engine is shut off or idling. When the car is at speed, the sump level drops and the shaft rotates in an oil mist/splash lubrication environment.[2] Some engine failures appear to be due to failure of the IMS bearing seal, allowing engine oil inside the bearing and washing out the grease contained within it Any contamination in the engine oil can result in increasing wear of the balls and ultimately failure of the bearing.[3] The bolt retaining the IMS bearing is also known to fail, which also leads to IMS bearing failure. Thirdly, poor timing between cams and crankshaft may contribute to unusually high wear on the IMS bearing, eventually leading to failure.IMS bearing failure rates are low, probably <10% of the total cars manufactured. Accepted solutions to prevent IMS bearing failure are either to replace the original bearing as a serviceable item, or to upgrade either to a ceramic-metal hybrid bearing, or a plain bearing lubricated by a forced oil feed. Where roller bearings continue to be used some people like to remove the bearing seals to allow oil to lubricate and cool the bearing.Maintaining good cam timing could also help reduce camshaft deviation therefore stresses on the IMS and its bearing.Cars made in 2006 to 2009 model years (potentially anything manufactured from 1 January 2005 to the end of the 997 model life) received an unserviceable bearing type. For these cars it is recommended to remove the bearing seal to allow oil to lubricate the bearing.In 2013 PCNA settled a class-action lawsuit brought by Bruce Eisen et al, without accepting liability. The lawsuit sought compensation for owners of MY2001 to MY 2005 Boxster and 996 cars that had experienced an IMS failure. The original action was to include the 1998 and 1999 M96 units, but the IMS failure rate on these 3.4L cars was so low that it was decided to exclude them from the action.[4]Porsche agreed to compensate owners of cars made between 4 May 2001 and 21 February 2005 who had experienced an IMS bearing failure within the first ten years of the car's life, or 130,000 miles, whichever came first. Owners who had changed the IMS bearing as a preventative measure were also eligible for compensation. Note however the schedule of payments was weighted heavily in the favour of cars purchased through the Approved Certified Pre-Owned Program (\"ACPO\").", "Porsche 997": "997 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 sports car manufactured and sold by German manufacturer Porsche between 2004 (as Model Year 2005) and 2012. Production of the Carrera and Carrera S coup\u00e9s began in early 2004, all-wheel drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S versions began shipping in November 2005, Turbo and GT3 derivatives went on sale in late 2006 and the 911 GT2 in 2007. In addition to the coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions, Targa versions of the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S were also available, which carry on with the \"glass canopy\" roof design used on all Targa 911s from the Type 993 Generation 911 until the 991, which replaced it in 2012.\nThe 997 was an evolution of the preceding 996, with the most significant changes being interior and exterior styling. Larger 18 inch wheels were fitted as standard, and other engineering changes include slightly increased power; however, the car is technically very similar to its predecessor. A new S version was offered, with additional power from a slightly larger engine, sports suspension, and sports exhaust.\nDuring 2009 Porsche updated the 997 line-up including styling changes, a revised engine with direct injection and the introduction of the company's new \"PDK\" dual clutch transmission. As a result, the updated 997 models were faster, lighter and more fuel efficient than the outgoing versions, with improved handling. In the case of the 997 Turbo, a comprehensively re-tuned all wheel drive system with an optional \"torque vectoring\" system was also a part of the upgrades package; in an October 2009 preliminary review, Car and Driver magazine estimated that when equipped with the PDK transmission, the updated Turbo should be capable of accelerating from 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in three seconds.\nThe 997 is the most commercially successful 911 of all time[citation needed], having sold 100,000 units of the first phase alone between its introduction in 2005 and July 2007. It has also received mostly positive reviews from the worldwide motoring press; even British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, a known detractor of Porsche cars, noted that the 997 will \"make love to your fingertips and stir your soul.\"[1]\nBy February 1999, just a few months into the 997 development programme that began in the fourth quarter of 1998, designers were already at work on the 997 body design. After numerous reviews during the rest of 1999 and full size clays built from 2000 into 2001, during 2001 a final design by designer Grant Larson was approved. Early prototypes were built in late 2001 for testing, based on the newly set parameters.[2] While the exterior styling was revised, it was again more evolution rather than revolution; typical of Porsche and the Carrera. The rear bodywork was a total of 88\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) wider than its predecessor. However, the most notable aesthetic difference between the 997 and the 996 was the return to oval headlights like those of pre-996 Carreras, with separate indicator units. The interior was re-designed with new controls; however, it was more reminiscent of classic 911 interiors than of the outgoing 996. The body in general remained low profile with a drag coefficient of 0.28 for the Carrera and 0.29 for the Carrera S.[3]\nThe base Carrera has essentially the same 3,596\u00a0cc (3.596\u00a0L; 219.4\u00a0cu\u00a0in) flat-6 (Boxer) engine from Type 996 Carrera. The Carrera S uses a new 3,824\u00a0cc (3.824\u00a0L; 233.4\u00a0cu\u00a0in) flat-6 engine. The X51 Powerkit is available for S, 4S, Targa models, which increases engine power.\nAccording to testing carried out by several American automotive publications, the Turbo model can accelerate from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in about 3.4 seconds with an automatic and 3.5 seconds with the manual transmission. The Carrera S model is capable of going 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.7 seconds, reaching a top speed of 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph), while the base Carrera model has 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) acceleration in 4.8 seconds, with a top speed of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h).\nThe viscous clutch all wheel drive system (997.1) sends between 5% and 40% of engine torque to the front wheels as needed.\nFor the first time, development of the cabriolet version of the 997 led the design and engineering effort at Porsche with the coup\u00e9 following. Porsche applied the logic that if you started with the more difficult cabriolet challenges (for chassis stiffness) the coup\u00e9 version would simply be more rigid. Despite additional weight, the cabriolet versions attain nearly the same performance figures as their coup\u00e9 counterparts. Even the rear tail comes up slightly higher on the cabriolets to compensate for differences in drag over the canvas top vs. the smoother coup\u00e9 shape.  Optional for the 997 Cabriolet models is a hardtop that encapsulated the vehicle in place of the canvas top.  It is interchangeable with that available on the late 996 cabriolet models.  The hardtop provides a winter option to cabriolet owners.\nA limited (50 units) version of 2006MY Carrera S coup\u00e9 with X51 Powerkit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Porsche Club of America (PCA).[4][5]\nThe vehicle included Azurro California-coloured body (from Porsche 356), vehicle identification number (VIN) which ended with the production number and special commemorative badging and door sills, Sport Chrono Package Plus system, and optional Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes.\nThe car #1 was transferred to the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, Germany and one PCA member won the car #50 in a sweepstakes drawing. The remaining 48 units were sold to randomly chosen U.S. and Canadian PCA members. After 2005-08-15, unsold units were made available to the general public.\nThe vehicle was unveiled in PCA's 50th Annual Porsche Parade in Hershey, Pa.\nThe vehicle had MSRP of $99,911 US and $145,911 CDN.[6]\nThe Targa 4 and 4S versions, like the Targa of the 993 and 996 generations, are equipped with a glass roof and hatch. At any speed, the roof can be opened where it drops down 25\u00a0mm and slides a metre back underneath the hatch. As the roof weighs an additional 60\u00a0kg (132\u00a0lb) the suspension has been modified from Carrera models. When the glass roof is retracted, a small glass deflector is raised above the windshield to aid aerodynamic stability.\nUnlike previous versions, the 997 Targa was only available as 4 wheel drive. Targa 4 models are slightly slower than the hard top Carrera models because of the heavier roof and all-wheel-drive transmission.\nThe 997 Targa became available in the fall of 2006 as a 2007 Model. In the first year, Porsche produced 1760 Targas worldwide (with 800 sold in the US market) out of 38,922 911 models produced in total.\nFollowing success of the earlier 996 Carrera C4S, the new Coup\u00e9, Cabriolet, and Targa versions were available from launch as Carrera or Carrera S, with the following additional features:\nApparently offered to counter criticism that the previous Carrera 996 was too soft and refined, S versions proved popular and outsold the standard versions.\n4 wheel drive versions had wider rear track to accommodate the additional drivetrain components. High performance versions, such as the GT2, used the wider bodyshell regardless of whether they were 2 or 4 wheel drive.\nThe 997 Turbo debuted in February 2006 at the Geneva Motor Show. It featured a new front bumper with LED turn signal strips in the air intakes; the fog lamps were moved to the corners of the bumpers. Large air vents fore and aft of the rear wheels provide other obvious visual cues of the Turbo model. Also featured was a retractable rear wing, as used on the 996 Turbo.\nThe engine was based on the rugged and reliable 964/GT1 design rated at 480\u00a0PS (350\u00a0kW; 470\u00a0hp) and 620\u00a0N\u22c5m (460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque. The turbochargers are fitted with a two-stage resonance intake system.\nThe engine uses two BorgWarner VTG turbos, a first for Porsche. The Variable Turbine Geometry incorporates guide vanes on the turbine wheel that change their angle of attack with exhaust speed, reducing boost lag at low speeds while opening up to prevent excessive back pressure at high RPM. With the exception of the 1988 Honda Legend Wing Turbo and 1989 Dodge Shelby CSX sedan,[7] such variable geometry turbines were previously only available on diesel engines.[citation needed]\nThe optional Sport Chrono package allows the 911 Turbo to overboost for ten seconds (1.0 bar to 1.2 bar), increasing peak torque over a narrow RPM range.\nAccording to official Porsche figures, the 997 Turbo Gen 1 accelerates from a standstill to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 3.9 seconds with the manual transmission, and 3.7 seconds with the 5-speed Tiptronic S transmission. Benchmark times to 200\u00a0km/h (124\u00a0mph) are 12.8 and 12.2 seconds, respectively. Maximum speed with either transmission is 310\u00a0km/h (193\u00a0mph).\nAs an option, Porsche also offered its ceramic brake system, PCCB (Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake). The advantages of this high-tech material mean a reduction of 17Kg compared to the standard brake system, excellent fade resistance owing to consistent friction values, and absolute corrosion resistance. The brakes were 380mm diameter at the front and 350mm at the rear.\nPorsche AG announced on May 7, 2007 that the 911 Turbo Cabriolet would go on sale in September 2007. The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet became one of the fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coup\u00e9, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coup\u00e9s, such as the poor aerodynamics of a soft top, a lack of torsional rigidity, and the consequential weight increase from structural members.\nAt its release, the Porsche 997-generation 911 GT2 was the most powerful and fastest road-going 911 ever to have been sold to the public.[8] The Porsche 996 911 GT2 was superseded by the 997-generation GT2, on sale since November 2007.\nThe 997 GT2 engine was based on the existing 3.6 L (220 cu in) flat-6 engine, but features twin variable geometry turbochargers, which generate 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp) at 6500 rpm and 680 N\u22c5m (500 lb\u22c5ft) at 2200 rpm.[8] Unlike 997 Turbo, the 997 GT2 uses a rear wheel drive layout for reduced weight, and boasts a power increase from a newly designed expansion intake manifold, and shorter turbo intake manifolds. Further, a full titanium silencer was fitted to the 997 GT2. Despite the power hike, Porsche claims fuel consumption at full throttle is improved by 15 percent compared with the 997 Turbo.[8] The GT2 accelerates in 3.6 seconds to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and in 7.4 seconds to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and has top speed of 329\u00a0km/h (204\u00a0mph). This makes it the first Porsche 911 GT2 to exceed the 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) top speed after the 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Race Version (which is not considered an actual Porsche 911 due to its mid-mounted engine and it only saw roads for homologation purposes). The Porsche 997 GT2 has a curb weight of 1,440\u00a0kg (3,170\u00a0lb). The only transmission choice is a 6-speed manual gearbox.\nThe GT2 was the first Porsche equipped with launch control.[8]\nIts appearance is slightly different from its sister-car, the Porsche 911 (997) Turbo, in a few ways. It does not have fog lights in the front bumper, it has a revised front lip, it has a larger rear wing (with two small air scoops on either side), and it has a different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes).\nThe 997 GT3 model also debuted in Geneva in 2006. Like previous GT3 models, it is a way for Porsche to homologate aerodynamic features for racing, as well as a starting model for customer racing. The 997 GT3 was priced at US$106,000. The engine has the same displacement as the Turbo, but without turbocharger and uses a new variable intake system. The engine is rated at 415\u00a0PS (305\u00a0kW; 409\u00a0hp) and 405\u00a0N\u22c5m (299\u00a0lb\u22c5ft).[9] It has an 8,400 rpm redline which is the same as the 612\u00a0bhp (456\u00a0kW; 620\u00a0PS) Carrera GTs. The 3.6L dry-sump engine does not suffer from the rear main seal problems of the earlier 3.6L/3.8L integrated dry-sump engines.\nThe GT3 body includes a special front bumper which increases cooling for the front-mounted radiators as well as a split spoiler at the rear. The GT3 also includes a special rear bumper and center tailpipes which draw heat away from the engine.  It is lowered and rides on 30-series 305\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) tyres on 19\u00a0in (483\u00a0mm) wheels. The car weighs 3075\u00a0lb (1395\u00a0kg).\nThe 997 GT3 is more driver-friendly than its predecessor, with \"comfort\" seats and the Porsche Communication Management system installed.\nThe special RS model[10] came without most of these luxuries to focus more on track-orientated driving (although the car is still road-legal). The package also included a full rollcage and carbon fiber seats to add to that race-car-for-the-road feel. The RS version was released in Europe in October 2006; the North American release was in March 2007.[11] A racing version of the GT3 RS debuted in 2007, and it was called the 997 GT3 RSR.\nThe ratios on the six-speed transmission are closer, allowing the GT3 to reach 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.1 seconds, while the RS accomplishes the same in exactly 4. It will continue to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in 9.2 seconds and has an unlimited top speed of 310\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).\nModels with turbocharged engines include Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) turbochargers.\nThe 997 was revised in 2008 for the 2009 model year. The updated Porsche 911 (called 997 Gen II internally at Porsche[12] and 997.2 informally by enthusiasts) included following changes:\nProduction began in late 2008. Pricing was increased from the 997, Gen I; the base Carrera model was set to start at US$76,300 for North American buyers.\nInitially available models included coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions of Carrera, Carrera 4, Carrera S and Carrera 4S. The car was unveiled at the Paris Auto Show in September 2008.\nOn June 6, 2008, these changes to the Porsche 911 were revealed on the Porsche website. The Turbo would had to wait until the Frankfurt show in September, thereafter the Turbo-based GT2 would be updated.[17]\nThe updated Targa 4 and Targa 4S models were announced on the 28th of July 2008. The new Targa 4S has a top track speed of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h) and accelerates from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.7 seconds, while the Targa 4 has a lower top speed.[20]\nThe facelifted version of the 997 Turbo was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. It received a completely new 6-cylinder, 3.8 litre boxer engine delivering 500\u00a0hp (370\u00a0kW) with a revised BorgWarner variable turbine geometry (VTG) turbos. The 911 Turbo was now only available with a manual gearbox or the optional 7-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox, which replaced the Tiptronic. With PDK and the also optional sport-chrono package, which includes the availability of an electronically controlled launch control and an overboost-function for temporarily increasing the turbo-pressure, Porsche claimed the 911 turbo would accelerate from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 3.4 seconds and attain a top-speed of 194\u00a0mph (312\u00a0km/h). However, several tests done by auto magazines and impartial testers have revealed that the 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h acceleration-time is generally as low as 2.9 seconds. The model could now also be ordered with PTV, Porsche Torque Vectoring, which will brake the inner wheel to provide turning-torque through a curve. The look of the facelifted model was left mostly untouched from the original 997 turbo, but there are subtle changes to the rear lights, now being LED-type, among changes to the front lamps. The exhaust pipes are now also \"fatter\" and the standard 19-inch (480\u00a0mm) wheels now have a new design. Thanks to revised dynamics the facelifted 997 can handle 1.3 g forces on a skid-pad according to Porsche. It is believed that the updated 997 Turbo was benchmarked against the Nissan GT-R in response to 3rd party testing between the 997 Turbo and the GT-R.\nModels equipped with the PDK also include an optional 3-spoke steering wheel with gearshift paddles as an alternative to the standard steering wheel with shift buttons.\nOther optional equipment include Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV).\nProduction versions went on sale in Germany in November 2009. European models have MSRP of \u20ac122,400 for Coup\u00e9 and \u20ac131,800 for the Cabriolet (before tax).[21]\nA more powerful version of the Turbo was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2010. Available only with a 7-speed PDK transmission, the Turbo S boosts power by 30\u00a0hp (22\u00a0kW) to a total of 530\u00a0hp (395\u00a0kW) and torque of 700 Nm.[22] European deliveries were scheduled for May 2010 with production ending in fall 2012. The Turbo S was Porsche fastest production vehicle to date alongside the GT2 RS, 0-60\u00a0mph acceleration: 2.6 seconds. Maximum torque of 516\u00a0lb-ft in the 911 Turbo S models was available between 2,100 rpm and 4,250 rpm. The 911 Turbo S models, by contrast, are configured to operate with a higher boost pressure level, which means that their maximum torque of 516\u00a0lb-ft is available for an unlimited period.\nThe 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, and became available in Europe starting in May, and in the US starting in October.[17] It featured minor changes to the exterior to improve aerodynamics. Total downforce was doubled, and for the first time stability control was offered as an option to help less experienced drivers.[23] Power output rises from 415 to 435 PS with the new 3.8L engine.[17]\nThe GT3 and GT3 RS were developed by Porsche's Motorsport Division in Weissach. Sales began in September 2009 for all regions except China. Options included titanium double exhaust pipes, carbon fibre rear spoiler lip (Gurney flap) and rear lid ram air scoop, carbon fibre front above bumper air outlet and rear-view mirrors, forged aluminium 19-inch (480\u00a0mm) GT3 wheels with central locking.[24]\nThe GT3 RS is a high performance version of the GT3 with a higher engine power output, lower weight and shorter transmission ratios, as well as upgraded body and suspension components, designed for homologating the race version of the 911 GT3. The engine was rated 451\u00a0PS (332\u00a0kW; 445\u00a0hp) with 8500 rpm redline. The \"RS\" stands for the German \"RennSport\", meaning \"Racing Sport\" in English.\nThe transmission has shorter ratios than found in the 911 GT3 for improved acceleration. Dynamic engine mounts are standard and serve to improve the car's handling to an even higher level. Other features include PASM suspension, a titanium crankshaft, a wider front and rear track and corresponding bodywork.\nOptional equipment include lithium-ion battery, which is 10\u00a0kg (22\u00a0lb) lighter than stock lead-acid battery. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The US model was set to go on sale in early spring of 2010 with an MSRP of US$132,800.[25]\nThe GT3 Cup is a Porsche Carrera Cup race car based on the 911 GT3 RS. It includes a 44\u00a0mm (1.7\u00a0in) wider rear body, 15\u00a0mm (0.59\u00a0in) lower front spoiler lip, 1.70\u00a0m (67\u00a0in) rear wing (from 911 GT3 Cup S race car), LED taillights, racing exhaust system with a fully controlled catalytic converter, a modified special exhaust system offering more dynamic and muscular sound (from Porsche Mobil1 Supercup cars), Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. 9.5Jx18 front alloy wheels with 24/64-18 Michelin racing tyres and 12Jx18 alloy wheels with 27/68-18 tyres, additional Unibal joints on the track control arms and front and rear sword-shaped anti-roll bars with seven position settings each, additional vent in the upper part of the front lid, steering wheel mounted Info Display with 6 switches, Carrara White body. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.\nProduction model began delivery in 2009\u20132010. European model has base MSRP of \u20ac149,850 (before tax).[26]\nThe Sport Classic is a limited (250 units- all sold in under 48 hours) version of the 911 Carrera S coup\u00e9, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7. The engine is rated at 408\u00a0PS (300\u00a0kW; 402\u00a0hp) and features a newly developed resonance intake manifold with 6 vacuum-controlled switching flaps. It includes a 6-speed manual transmission, double-dome roof, 44\u00a0mm (1.7\u00a0in) wider rear fenders, SportDesign front apron with a spoiler lip and a fixed 'duck tail' rear wing (similar to the one found on the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7), PCCB Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, 20\u00a0mm (0.8\u00a0in) lower PASM sports suspension, mechanical rear axle differential, 19-inch black Fuchs wheels, Porsche Exclusive woven leather seats and door panels, dashboard with Espresso Nature natural leather upholstery, and a specially developed Sport Classic Grey body colour.\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto show.[27]\nSales began in January 2010. European models had base MSRP of \u20ac169,300 (before tax).[28]\nTop Gear featured the car during Season 15's second episode on July 4, 2010.\nOn May 4, 2010, an RS variant of the GT2 was announced to German dealers in Leipzig. The GT2 RS develops 620 PS (456\u00a0kW; 612\u00a0hp) and 700 N\u00b7m (516\u00a0lb\u00b7ft) of torque and weighs 70\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lb) less than the standard GT2. This allows it to be able to reach a top speed of 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph) and accelerate from 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (0-62\u00a0mph) in 3.5 seconds. It was the fastest and the most powerful 911 built of its generation.[29]\nAccording to Porsche Motorsports manager Andreas Preuninger, the RS was conceived around 2007 as a skunk-works effort. The 727 code number selected for the project corresponds to one of the Nissan GT-R's lap times around the Nurburgring's Nordschleife. When the dust settled, Porsche claimed that test driver Timo Kluck had supposedly eclipsed that target by an impressive nine seconds.\nA total of 131 units were sold in the United States and 10 units in Canada.[30]\nFor 2011, Porsche launched a new, mid-level 911 coming in above the Carrera and below the GT3. Ranging from $103,100 to $112,900 USD, the Carrera GTS is available as both a coup\u00e9 and cabriolet, the car gets a wider body and track \u2013 the only Carrera with a wide track that is also rear wheel drive. The car also has an upgraded 3.8-litre engine producing 408 metric horsepower (300\u00a0kW).[31] An AWD version, the Carrera 4 GTS was revealed in May, 2011. In addition to the AWD system, the Carrera 4 GTS can be identified by a distinct reflective stripe between the tail lights.[32]\nIn 2011, Porsche introduced a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356, the production number coming from the iconic car of the 1950s. It was the third 911 Speedster made, the other two being from the 930 and 964 generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS, and produced 408 horsepower (304\u00a0kW). It accelerated from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h). Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers).\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70\u00a0mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\nIn April 2011, rumours of a 4.0 litre version of the 997 GT3 RS started appearing in various automotive publications, soon followed by supposed spy shots and rendered images.  Eventually, Porsche revealed that they were making the 911 GT3 RS 4.0, the final evolution of the 997 featuring a 4.0 litre engine. The engine itself features the crankshaft from the RSR with increased stroke dimensions (from 76.4\u00a0mm to 80.4\u00a0mm). This has increased the power to 500\u00a0PS (368\u00a0kW; 493\u00a0hp) at 8250 rpm and 460\u00a0N\u22c5m (339\u00a0lbf\u22c5ft) of torque at 5750 rpm. Chassis development has been influenced by the GT2 RS and uses parts sourced from other RS 911s. Front dive planes give additional downforce up front. The car weighs in at 1370\u00a0kg, giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 365\u00a0bhp per ton. Only 600 cars were planned.[33]\nAll models include standard 6-speed manual transmission. 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) transmission is available in all but GT3, GT3 RS, GT3 Cup, GT3 RS 4.0, GT2, GT2 RS, Sport Classic models. PDK transmission includes Sport Plus setting that includes launch control and motorsport derived gearshifting.\nIn June 2009 Porsche Cars North America partnered with five New York City street artists to unveil five graffiti-decorated Porsche 911 hoods in the Helenbeck Gallery. The hoods were sold to raise funds for CITYarts, a New York City-based organization whose mission is to bring children in contact with public artists.[35]\n", "Porsche 986": "The Porsche 986 is the internal designation for the first generation Boxster, a mid-engined two-seater roadster built by Porsche. It was Porsche's first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The car was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine. The design was heavily influenced by the 1992 Boxster Concept. In 2000, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine and the new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants.\nProduction of the 986 began at the former Porsche 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Boxster was Porsche's biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the company introduced the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003.[1]\nThe Boxster's name is derived from the word \"boxer\", referring to the vehicle's flat or \"boxer\" engine, and the word \"roadster\", referring to the vehicle's two-seater capacity and convertible top.[2] The Boxster was released ahead of the more expensive 911 (internal designation 996) and has the same bonnet, front wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture as that model.\nIn October 1991 following a visit to the Tokyo Motor Show, Porsche began to devise solutions to succeed the poor selling 928 and incoming 968 (a heavy update of 944). In February 1992, Porsche began development of a successor to the 928 (mildly updated for 1992) and recently released 968.[3]\nBy June 1992, out of 4 proposals based on dual collaboration between 986 and 996 (993 successor) design teams, a proposal by Grant Larson and Pinky Lai inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder was chosen by Harm Lagaay.[1]\nIn August 1992, a decision was made to develop the concept into a show vehicle, in time for the 1993 North American International Auto Show. After garnering widespread acclaim from the press and public upon presentation of the Boxster Concept in January 1993, the final production 986 production exterior design by Larson was frozen in March 1993. However, by the second half of 1993, difficulties arose with fitment of some components, resulting in lengthening of the hood and requiring another design freeze by fourth quarter of that year. Prototypes in 968 bodies were built to test mid-engine power train of the 986 by the end of 1993, with proper prototypes surfacing in 1994. Pilot production began in the second half of 1995, ahead of series production in mid-1996.[1]\nThrough consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs.[4][1] The car stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche, and it credited with saving the company, which during the early 1990s had been suffering with an ageing product range and falling sales.[1][3]\nAll 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed (\"flat\"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines had a number of failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast at the same time as the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.\nThe model received a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the front headlight's amber indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available.\n\nIn 2004 the 550 Spyder 50th Anniversary Edition was released with a production run of just 1953 cars. These were all painted GT Silver Metallic, the same colour as the Carrera GT concept presented in 2000, and had unique cocoa-brown full-leather interior as standard with grey natural leather as a no-cost option. Each car also had special interior paintwork, a high-end BOSE sound system, two-tone grey and silver 18\" Carrera wheels (unpainted as another zero-cost option), 5\u00a0mm (0.2\u00a0in) wheel spacers, the Boxster S sport exhaust, the M030 option sports suspension, and a plate on the center console piece commonly known as the \"batwing\" showing the production number. Only on the American market cars were the rear turn signals red rather than clear.", "Porsche 981": "Boxster: 3,035\u00a0lb (1,377\u00a0kg) (2.7 manual)[2]\nBoxster S: 3,070\u00a0lb (1,390\u00a0kg) (manual)[3]\nBoxster S: 3,139\u00a0lb (1,424\u00a0kg) (PDK)[4] \nBoxster GTS: 3,163\u00a0lb (1,435\u00a0kg) (PDK)[5]\nCayman: 3,083\u00a0lb (1,398\u00a0kg) (manual)[6]\nCayman S: 3,131\u00a0lb (1,420\u00a0kg) (PDK)[7]\nCayman GTS: 3,083\u00a0lb (1,398\u00a0kg) (manual)[8]\nThe Porsche 981 is the internal designation given to the third-generation Porsche Boxster/Cayman models built by Porsche. It was announced on 13 March 2012 at the Geneva Auto Show with sales starting early summer 2012. The 981 reflects the new design language from the 911 (991) and 918, and features new and revised engine and transmission specifications. \nTogether with a new body, the type 981 features a new chassis; 40 per cent more torsionally rigid, the front track is 40mm wider, the rear 18mm wider and the wheelbase extended by 60mm, but with a small weight reduction of up to 35 kilograms (77\u00a0lb) compared to the previous type 987.[10] It was the last Boxster/Cayman to feature a six cylinder engine. Its 2016 replacement, the 982 features a four cylinder unit. \nThe standard Boxster is fitted with a new 2.7-litre flat-6 engine, and the Boxster S is fitted with the existing 3.4-litre engine but with revised performance. Both engines are equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox and an optional 7-speed reworked PDK. Both manual and automatic models are available with several technical options including Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a Sport Chrono Package that includes active transmission mounts, and makes the PDK-equipped model even faster. Porsche claims that the new generation Boxster provides fuel savings of 15% over the outgoing model. \nThe range was expanded in March 2014 with the addition of the GTS derivative, with slightly altered front and rear bumpers and an additional 15\u00a0bhp from the 3.4-litre engine.[11]\nPorsche revealed the latest Boxster Spyder based on the 981 Boxster in April 2015 at the New York Auto Show. The styling of the car is similar to the previous generation Spyder, continuing the twin hump rear deck and manually operated canvas top. It also shares some styling with the Cayman GT4, using the same front and rear fascia. The engine is also shared with the Cayman GT4, a 3.8 litre flat-6, making this the largest and most powerful engine used in a Boxster with 287 kilowatts (385\u00a0bhp). \nIt was the lightest Porsche, weighing 1,315 kilograms (2,899\u00a0lb). This was achieved through the use of aluminium doors and rear boot lid, a manually operated roof and unique lightweight 20 inch wheels. The air conditioning and audio system were also removed, although they can be added as no cost options. Braking is via larger brakes than used on the Boxster S, being 340mm front and 330mm rear units taken from the 911 Carrera S. Also shared with the GT4 is a limited slip differential combined with Porsche Torque Vectoring and features a 30mm lower ride height. \nAdditionally it also borrows the steering rack from the 911 Turbo S along with the same reduced diameter GT steering wheel as used in both the GT3 and GT4.  The Boxster Spyder was only available with a 6 speed manual transmission. The Spyder had a base price of US$82,100 and was only available as a 2016 model with a total worldwide production of 2400 units, with 850 destined for the US.[citation needed]\nThe 2.7 has a drag coefficient of\u00a0Cd=0.30, the S Cd=0.31, the GTS Cd=0.32 and the Spyder Cd=0.33\nThe second generation Cayman was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The production 981 was released as a 2014 model in the spring of 2013. The new car was available in both the standard trim with a 2.7 L engine, and in the S trim with a 3.4 L engine. Both versions are available with either a 6-speed manual or a dual-clutch 7-speed PDK transmission.\nThe 981 features upgrades including a new body, a longer wheelbase, a wider front track, and a redesigned interior that matches the firm's contemporary 911 models.\nThe new model gained acclaim in the motoring press as one of the best handling sports cars at any price, due to its-mid engine layout and driving dynamics. The Cayman S benefits from the same engine and running gear as Porsche's latest 3.4 L version of the 911.\n[16][17][18][19]\nThe Cayman GTS was introduced in 2014, and is based on the 981 platform. It features a marginally more powerful engine, a new body kit, new 20-inch Carrera S wheels, new Bi-Xenon headlights, and a new sports exhaust system. The Cayman GTS is longer than the Cayman and the Cayman S by 1.2 inches due to its bumpers. The new, optional passive sport suspension allows the Cayman GTS to have a 20mm lower ride height compared to a car equipped with standard passive suspension or 10mm lower compared to one with the standard-equipped PASM. The engine produces 340\u00a0hp (254\u00a0kW; 345\u00a0PS), and can achieve a 0-62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) acceleration time of 4.9 seconds with the manual transmission, 4.7 seconds with PDK and 4.5 seconds with PDK and Sport Plus mode, which is activated via the now standard Sports Chrono Package. The Cayman GTS weighs 1,385\u00a0kg (3,053\u00a0lb) with the manual transmission and can attain a top speed of 177\u00a0mph (285\u00a0km/h) while the Cayman GTS with PDK can reach 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) and weighs 1,375\u00a0kg (3,031\u00a0lb). The configuration changes made over a standard Cayman S resemble closely what Porsche did to its predecessors through Cayman S Sport and Cayman R in the 987 generation models.\n[20]\n[21]\nIn 2015, the Cayman GT4 was introduced, based on the then current generation of the Cayman (981C), using a revised and a slightly de-tuned version of the 3.8-litre flat-six engine from the 911 (991) Carrera S. The GT4 was available only with a 6 speed manual transmission and weighed 1,340\u00a0kg (2,954\u00a0lb). It has a vented front bumper to improve cooling for the additional radiator, with a lower lip as well as a fixed rear wing for providing downforce. Compared to the standard Cayman, it features a 30mm lower ride height, upgraded brakes from the 991 GT3, a limited slip differential combined with Porsche Torque Vectoring, and Porsche Active Suspension Management with dampers derived from the 991 GT3. A number of reinforcements were also made throughout the chassis to keep it stiff and well balanced. A Club Sport Package is also available, featuring a rear half rollcage, preparation for a battery cut off switch, a fire extinguisher and a six-point racing harness for the driver, compatible with a neck saving HANS device. Sport Chrono Package with unique Track Precision app is also available specifically for the GT4, adding an additional ECU to the car to deliver telemetry data to the driver's smartphone.\nIn the United Kingdom, the GT4 could be ordered before its introduction at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show in March, and the first cars would arrive in dealerships in March.\nThe Cayman GT4 has a projected N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife lap time of 7 minutes 40 seconds[22][23] and has a top speed of 183\u00a0mph (295\u00a0km/h).[24] The GT4 has gained rave reviews from magazines like Evo and the likes of Chris Harris. The GT4 also represents the last mid-engine track focused car with a naturally aspirated Flat-6 engine coupled to a 6-speed manual transmission, a combination that would disappear after the introduction of the turbocharged Flat-4 in the 718 Cayman.\nOn 6 October 2015, Porsche announced a Clubsport version of the Cayman GT4. Developed by Porsche Motorsport, the Cayman GT4 Clubsport made its debut at the 2015 LA Auto Show in November. It is powered by the same 3.8-litre boxer 6 cylinders engine rated at 385\u00a0PS (380\u00a0bhp; 283\u00a0kW) @ 7,400 rpm and 420\u00a0N\u22c5m (310\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4,750 rpm of torque found on the production Cayman GT4.[25]\nAs opposed to the road going Cayman GT4, the Clubsport version is fitted with Porsche's PDK double clutch transmission (albeit with 7th gear disabled) with shift paddles on the steering wheel, as well as mechanical rear-axle locking differential. The Cayman GT4 Clubsport weighs only 1,300\u00a0kg (2,866\u00a0lb) and shares the same Performance Friction brakes and lightweight suspension strut front axle found on the Porsche 991 GT3 Cup. Its ABS is adjustable in 12 steps. A 100-litre FIA-approved \"bag\" fuel tank is available as an option for endurance racing. In addition to its lightweight features, it is supplied fitted with an FIA welded-in roll-cage, six-point harness and racing bucket seats.\nSales of the new Cayman GT4 Clubsport commenced after its debut in November through Porsche Motorsport in Weissach or Porsche Motorsport North America.\n", "Porsche 982": "Boxster/Cayman:2,944\u00a0lb (1,335\u00a0kg) (manual), 3,010\u00a0lb (1,370\u00a0kg) (PDK)[2][3]\nBoxster S/Cayman S:2,988\u00a0lb (1,355\u00a0kg) (manual), 3,054\u00a0lb (1,385\u00a0kg) (PDK)[4][5]\nThe Porsche 982 is the internal designation of the fourth generation Boxster/Cayman made by Porsche. With the switch to a new turbocharged flat-four engine the marketing name for the models was changed to Porsche 718, in reference to the Porsche 718, which won the Targa Florio race in 1959 and 1960. The name is meant to evoke Porsche's past racing successes with light cars like the 718 that outmanoeuvred competitors with larger and more powerful engines.[8][9]\nThe 718 was introduced in June 2016. The 718 base featured two new horizontally-opposed flat-4 turbocharged engines at 2.0L and 2.5L displacement with increased torque and horsepower with lower fuel consumption. The S model turbocharger utilizes Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) technology.[10][11]\nLater, In October 2017 the GTS models were announced with their 2.5l engines upgraded to produce 361 bhp. The Boxster could reach 60 mph in 4.1 seconds, and the Cayman in 3.9 seconds.[12]\nThe exterior of the 718 Boxster and Cayman is very similar to the third generation, more of an evolution than a redesign. The most notable changes are to the rear of the car, which now has a long black-trim bar across the rear connecting the two taillights. The headlights and bumper are also heavily reworked. On the sides, the mirrors have been redesigned, taking hue from the SportDesign mirrors on the GT3.\nThe interior remains very similar to the 981 Cayman / Boxster and the 991.2 generation of the Porsche 911. The main change is the new PCM 4.0 infotainment system, which replaces the PCM 3.1.[13] The steering wheel comes with a mode selector switch that includes a selection of Sports and Sports Plus driving modes, resulting in snappier throttle response at the cost of fuel efficiency. Overall, the most prominent design features of the 981 Cayman / Boxster remain, including large air induction ports on the side, and the prominent horizontal aluminum piece used for adding oil and coolant in the trunk.[14]\nDespite the loss of two cylinders, the 718 Cayman / Boxster was assessed to be mechanically superior to the 981 model with improved acceleration and steering.[15] The 718 Cayman was declared Motor Trend's 2nd best Drivers car in 2017, which praised the car's handling and throttle response. Giving the award, Miguel Cortina noted, \"The suspension is just what you want to feel in a car like this\u2014stiff, sporty, rigid. You get a very good sense of what is happening on the road.\"[16]\nBy far, the most contentious reaction to the 718 Cayman was the sound of the engine - which received nearly universal criticism by the automotive press. Car and Driver called it a, \"raspy, uncouth sound that strikes some drivers as unpleasant and grating.\"[17] Top Gear noted that the sound, \"fundamentally cheapens the Porsche experience,\" and make the car, \"less upmarket, less cultured and sophisticated than it did before.\"[18] However, Motor Trend's Ignition tested the 718 Cayman against the 981 Cayman GT4, and found that the performance gains were so strong the car had the capability to outmanoeuvre the GT4 at a much lower price. They concluded that the tradeoff was probably worth it.[19]\nThe 718 GTS variant of the Cayman and Boxster was released to generally positive reviews. Visually, the front headlight and rear tailights were smokey black, and an aggressive front sports fascia was added. Performance upgrades included Porsche Sports Exhaust, a Sports Chrono Package, Porsche Stability Management were all added as standard features. By expanding the air intake, the 718 GTS has an additional 15 horsepower and even more torque than the 718 S. In addition, carmine red was added as a color as a $2580 option. Used in most of Porsche advertising with the GTS, the color is darker than Porsche Guards Red, and very similar to the Italian racing color used by Ferrari, Rosso Corso.[20]\nMany reviewers, including New York Times contributor Tom Voelk, noted that the 718 GTS had a much more pleasing sound than the base 718 and the 718 S. \u201cOne of the biggest complaints of the 718 is that its turbo 4 engine doesn\u2019t have the distinctive sound that the outgoing 6 cylinder had,\u201d said Voelk. \u201cBut the 718 GTS sounds much better. It has different intakes and a larger turbo.\u201d The sound of the 718 GTS engine has much more prominent bass frequencies, which contrast with a strong treble pitch of the turbocharger.[21]\nHowever, Evo magazine argues that, while \"capable of challenging the 911 as a true sports car\", the \"718 version of the GTS doesn't really achieve anything more than the Cayman GTS it replaces\" and \"with its more desirable engine, it's the previous model that feels more exotic and like a much higher quality product.\" It describes the GTS' engine as \"a nasty sounding motor\", the noise from the turbo four-cylinder in the cabin as \"dreadful\" and \"tuneless drivel\" and contests that \"the only redeeming feature of the 718 GTS sonically is that this is probably the quietest iteration of this motor\".[22]\nPorsche 718 Boxster S\nPorsche 718 Cayman S\nPorsche 718 Cayman GTS\n", "Porsche 987": "The Porsche 987 is the internal designation for the second generation Porsche Boxster sports car. It made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the new 911 (997) and went on sale in 2005. \nIn 2007, it was joined in the range by the new Cayman fastback coup\u00e9 (project 987c) with which it shared the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. \nThe 987 was the second generation Boxster model, but remained very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche's mid-engined supercar. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19\u00a0inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. \nThe most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor.[citation needed] The base engine is a 2.7\u00a0L 176\u00a0kW (240\u00a0hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2\u00a0L 206\u00a0kW (280\u00a0hp) engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coup\u00e9 is derived from the 987.\nFor 2007 the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a 5\u00a0hp (3.7\u00a0kW) boost (245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S engine was upgraded from 3.2L to 3.4L, resulting in the production of 15\u00a0hp (11\u00a0kW) more (295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.\nPorsche first revealed the facelifted 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. Both models feature greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche's new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster's flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from 245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) to 255\u00a0hp (190\u00a0kW). Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from 295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) to 310\u00a0hp (230\u00a0kW). Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated day time running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.[3]\nBoxster 987 Gen II model history\nIn November 2007, Porsche announced a commemorative RS60 Spyder edition of the Boxster to celebrate Porsche's 1960 win in the 12 Hours of Sebring in Florida.[4]  Only 1960 units were produced worldwide, with approximately 800 slated for the U.S. with each model bearing a numbered production badge on the dash. The RS60 Spyder comes in only GT Silver Metallic while the standard interior is Carrera Red leather, with dark gray leather as an option.  The RS60 comes standard with 19\u00a0inch SportDesign alloy wheels, Porsche's Active Suspension Management System, and a sports exhaust that boosts the engine output to 303\u00a0PS (223\u00a0kW; 299\u00a0hp). The base price for the RS60 Spyder was US$64,900.\nThe limited production Boxster S Porsche Design Edition 2 debuted in October 2008 as 2009 model.[5] It featured a free-flowing exhaust system, which raised power from 295\u00a0PS (217\u00a0kW; 291\u00a0hp) at 6250\u00a0rpm to 303\u00a0PS (223\u00a0kW; 299\u00a0hp) at an identical 6250\u00a0rpm. It came in a unified Carrera White paint scheme with matching white 19-inch wheels, a black and grey interior with white gauges, red taillights and light grey stripes along the entire body. 500 were made for the worldwide market, 32 shipped into the U.S. and 18 into Canada. The base price for the PDE2 Boxster was US$66,900.\nPorsche unveiled its 2008 Limited Edition Boxster and Boxster S models at a private gathering at the occasion of the 2007 New York Auto Show. Largely inspired by the 2007 911 GT3 RS, just 250 examples of each model were produced in brilliant orange and priced at $49,900 (original MSRP $45,800) and $59,900 (original MSRP $55,700) respectively.\nClad in the striking RS-special orange paint of the 911 GT3-RS with glossy black painted mirrors, alloy wheels, front and side air inlets, and model designation. The SportDesign package adds visual appeal, and includes aggressive front splitters, a revised rear two-stage spoiler that extends automatically at speed, and an integrated rear diffuser that Porsche says reduces aerodynamic lift. A sports exhaust system with a dual chromed exhaust tip is included, and is claimed to add a few more horsepower. Inside, a numbered 'Limited Edition' plaque is found on the glove box door, while the seat inserts, 911 GT3-spec steering wheel, and handbrake lever all receive Alcantara trim, a suede-like material used on performance Porsches like the 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 RS. Orange roll-over hoops, door lever surrounds, shift knob, cup-holder cover trim and even the font on the gear shift pattern carrying bright orange that match the exterior colour and offset the otherwise black interior.\nOn 5 November 2009, Porsche officially announced the creation of a new variant of the Boxster, which was officially unveiled at the 2009 Los Angeles Motor Show. Positioned above the Boxster S, the Boxster Spyder was the lightest Porsche on the market at the time, weighing 2,811 pounds (1,275\u00a0kg), a full 176 pounds (80\u00a0kg) lighter than a Boxster S. This was achieved through the elimination of the conventional soft top's operating mechanism, the radio/PCM unit, door handles, air conditioning, storage compartments, cupholders and large LED light modules on the front fascia. Although some of these could be re-added to the car in the form of options. Weight saving was also gained using aluminum doors, an aluminum rear deck and the lightest 19-inch wheels in the Porsche pallet. The vehicle rides on a firmer suspension than the other Boxster models, and is almost one inch lower in order to have improved handling. A manually operated canvas top, carbon fiber sports bucket seats and two signature humps running along the back of the vehicle provide characteristic design elements. It is powered by a six-cylinder boxer engine with 320 horsepower (239\u00a0kW; 324\u00a0PS) and 273\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (370\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque, a 10\u00a0hp (7.5\u00a0kW) increase in power over the Boxster S and the related Cayman S. The Boxster Spyder came with a 6-speed manual transmission as standard and had Porsche's 7-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox available as an option. The vehicle was released worldwide in February 2010 as a 2011 model with a base price of US$61,200.[6]\nAfter two years of development, the first model of the fastback coup\u00e9 to be released was the Cayman S (type 987120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling took place at the September Frankfurt Motor Show. The S suffix (for Sport[7] or Special[8]) indicated that this was a higher performance version of a then unreleased normal model. That model, the Cayman (987110), went on sale in July 2006. A motorsport-tuned model, the Cayman RS, was rumored to have been tested at the N\u00fcrburgring that same year.[9]\nThe Cayman fastback coup\u00e9 (project 987c) and the second generation Boxster roadster (project 987) shared the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman's body incorporates styling cues from classic Porsches; 356/1, the 550 Coup\u00e9 and the 904 Coup\u00e9.[10][11]\nUnlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a hatchback for access to luggage areas on top of and in the back of the engine cover. The entire aft portion of the Cayman is made from stainless steel. The suspension design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster with revised settings due to the stiffer chassis with the car's fixed roof.\nThe 3.4-litre flat-6 boxer engine (M97.21) in the first generation Cayman S was derived from the 3.2-litre (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, with cylinder heads from the Porsche 997 S's 3.8-litre motor (M97.01), which have the VarioCam Plus inlet valve timing and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7-litre M97.20, powered the base model. The use of these engines exclusively in Caymans ended in MY 2007 when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987310) and Boxster S (987320).[12]\nA 5-speed manual transaxle is standard on the Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual (Getrag 466) is the default for the S (G87.21) and an option on the base (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transaxle (Tiptronic) was also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replaced this option with a seven-speed \"PDK\", Porsche's dual-clutch robotic manual transmission). Other options include active shock absorbers (ThyssenKrupp Bilstein GmbH's DampTronic, rebadged as PASM by Porsche), ceramic disc brakes (PCCB), xenon headlights (Hella's Bi-Xenon) and an electronically controlled sport mode (Sport Chrono Package).\nThe first generation Cayman ceased production in November 2011.[13]\nThe performance of the Cayman S approaches that of Porsche's flagship sports car. Rally racing driver Walter R\u00f6hrl lapped the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife track in a Cayman S equipped with optional 19\" wheels, PCCB, and PASM[14] in a time of 8 minutes, 11 seconds.[15][16] The time for a standard Cayman S, as published by the manufacturer, was 8 minutes, 20 seconds.[17] In contrast, R\u00f6hrl recorded 8 minutes, 15 seconds in a 911 Carrera.[18][19]\nA Cayman prepared and run by private team of J\u00fcrgen and Uwe Alzen finished fourth overall (of 220 entrants) in the 2007 N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hour race, ahead of two flagship Porsche 997 GT3 RSR's, a 997 GT3 Cup, and a 996 GT3 Cup.[20] Another two privateer Caymans, entered by CSR and MSpeed, finished 22nd and 117th overall, respectively. Porsche disclaims support for the Cayman teams, while supporting some or all of the 997 teams.[21]\nStarting with the 2009 model, a limited slip differential was available as an option.[22] The base Cayman has received an engine upgrade to 2.9 L (265\u00a0bhp (198\u00a0kW; 269\u00a0PS)), and the Cayman S a 3.4 L (320\u00a0bhp (239\u00a0kW; 324\u00a0PS)). The factory tuned 2008 Cayman S Sport with its special exhaust system produces 303\u00a0bhp (226\u00a0kW; 307\u00a0PS) from its 3.4 L engine.[23]\nA facelifted version of the Porsche Cayman was introduced on 21 February 2009. The standard Cayman engine's displacement was increased from 2.7 L to 2.9 L, giving a 20\u00a0hp (15\u00a0kW) increase to 265\u00a0hp (198\u00a0kW), while the Cayman S gained direct injection and a 25\u00a0hp (19\u00a0kW) increase to 320\u00a0hp (239\u00a0kW). The new engines no longer had the Intermediate Shaft, which proved to be a weak link in pre-2009 engines, the new engine nomenclature is 9A1. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintained a 10\u00a0hp (7\u00a0kW) power advantage over their roadster sibling, the Boxster. Each has its own design for the front bumper. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman\u2019s are arranged like the face of dice{[26]} while the Boxster gets a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission for the new model. The PDK outperforms the manual transmission with a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 5.1 seconds versus 5.2 seconds for the manual. The PDK with the sport button option lowers the 0-60\u00a0mph time to 4.9 seconds.[27]\nAlso a limited slip differential is now a factory option.[28]\nThe Porsche Design Edition 1 is a Cayman S model designed by Porsche Design, commemorating the 35th anniversary of Porsche Design. The all black car has a black leather interior on the seats, dashboard, and door trim, as well as black Alcantara steering wheel, gear lever, handbrake grip, and headliner. The DE1 also is fitted standard with the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), 19-inch 911 (997) Turbo wheels with 235/35 ZR 19 front and 265/35 ZR 19 rear tires, Porsche Design script on the instrument dials, stainless steel entry plate engraved with \"Porsche Design Edition 1\", all-red rear taillights, custom vinyl exterior black-on-black graphics, and a numbered plaque on the glovebox cover. As with all PASM-equipped cars, the body is lowered by 10\u00a0mm (0.4\u00a0in). Standard equipment includes a briefcase containing the Flat Six Chronograph, a pocket knife, a pair of sunglasses, a pen, and a key ring \u2013 all in black, even the knife blade. A total of 777 vehicles were produced as 2008 models. It went on sale on November 2007 in Germany, followed by the U.S. in January 2008\nPorsche also announced the production of a limited edition Cayman S Sport, which was available in October 2008 as a 2009 model.[29] This version of the Cayman S includes PSE (Porsche Sports Exhaust), PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management), and Sport Chrono. The power is raised from 295\u00a0PS (217\u00a0kW) at 6250 rpm to 303\u00a0PS (223\u00a0kW) at 6250 rpm. The Cayman S Sport is the first Cayman to break 300\u00a0bhp from the factory.\nThe Cayman S Sport comes in Bright Orange and Signal Green (from the 911 GT3 RS), as well as Carrera White, Speed Yellow, Guards Red, Black, and Arctic Silver [special order at an extra cost]. The Cayman S Sport also features short shifter, sports seats, deviated color seatbelts, \"Cayman S\" striping on the door sides, black Porsche Design 19-inch wheels, various gloss black interior trims, gloss black side mirrors, stainless steel door sills with \"Cayman S Sport\" script, 5mm wheel spacers, and Alcantara steering wheel and shift knob from the 997 911 GT3 RS. The instrumentation does not include a hood. The body is lowered by 1\u00a0cm due to its PASM feature. A total of 700 were made with only 100 coming to the US.\nThe Cayman R was introduced in 2011, and is based on a 2009 Cayman S. It features the Porsche OEM aerokit that was first introduced in 2007 as a factory option, 19\u00a0inch lightweight wheels inherited from the Boxster Spyder, lighter aluminium doors from 997 911 GT3, lighter fiberglass bucket seats with carbon fiber backing from the 997 911 GT2, and with the removal of the radio, storage compartments, air-conditioning, and door handles, the Cayman R weighs in at 54.8 kilograms (121\u00a0lb) less than a Cayman S. The Cayman R also received various cosmetic changes similar to ones seen on the earlier Cayman S Sport, such decals on the doors, instrument cover delete, gloss black painted mirrors, black model designation emblem on the trunk, as well as black painted wheels.\nWith the new passive sports suspensions, the Cayman R was 10\u00a0mm (0.4\u00a0in) lower than a Cayman S equipped with PASM, or 20\u00a0mm (0.8\u00a0in) lower than one equipped with standard passive suspension. The powertrain was a 3,436\u00a0cc (3.4\u00a0L; 209.7\u00a0cu\u00a0in) direct injection Flat-six engine that produced 330\u00a0PS (325\u00a0bhp; 243\u00a0kW) @ 7,400 rpm and 370\u00a0N\u22c5m (273\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) @ 4,750 rpm of torque. The standard Cayman R can achieve 0-100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 5 seconds, and with the optional 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission and the Sport Chrono package, it can achieve 0-100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 4.9 seconds. The Cayman R with the manual transmission can reach the top speed of 282\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) and 280\u00a0km/h (174\u00a0mph) with the PDK.[30][31][32] The Cayman R made its debut at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show on 17 November 2010.\n Specifications \nSource:[36]\n", "Porsche Boxster/Cayman": "\nThe Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are mid-engined two-seater sports cars built by Porsche. There have been four generations; the first generation Boxster, a 2-door, 2-seater roadster was released in 1996. The Cayman, a 2-door, 2-seater fastback coup\u00e9 based on the second generation Boxster went on sale in late 2005. A third generation was released in 2012, and since the fourth generation of 2016, the two models have been marketed jointly as the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman. \nThe Porsche Boxster is a mid-engined two-seater roadster. It was Porsche's first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The first-generation Boxster (the 986) was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine. The design was heavily influenced by the 1992 Boxster Concept. In 2000, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine and the new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants.\nProduction of the 986 began at the former Porsche 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Boxster was Porsche's biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the company introduced the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003. As of September 2012, additional production of the 981 started at the former Karmann-factory in Osnabr\u00fcck.[2]\nIn 2005, Porsche unveiled the second generation of Boxster: the type 987. The 987 is more powerful than its predecessor and featured styling inspired by the Carrera GT. Engine output increased in 2007, when both Boxster models received the engines from their corresponding Porsche Cayman variants. In 2009, the Boxster models received several new cosmetic and mechanical upgrades, further increasing engine output and performance. The third generation Boxster (type 981) was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.\nThe Boxster's name is derived from the word \"boxer\", referring to the vehicle's flat or \"boxer\" engine, and the word \"roadster\", referring to the vehicle's two-seater capacity and convertible top.\nFirst launched in the 2006 model year, the Cayman is a coup\u00e9 derived from Porsche's second and third generation Boxster roadster. The designer of the first generation of Porsche Cayman was Pinky Lai. Like the Boxster, most Caymans were assembled in Finland for Porsche by Valmet Automotive (the rest were assembled in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart, Germany). Porsche's Deputy Chairman, Holger P. Haerter stated that the contract with Valmet Automotive will end in 2012, and the Cayman's production was to be outsourced to Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria.[3] However, as Volkswagen assumed control of Porsche AG, production of Caymans and Boxsters after 2012 began in the former Karmann plant in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, which is now owned by Volkswagen and also used for production of the 2012 Golf (Mk6) convertible.[4]\nCayman is an alternative spelling of caiman, a reptile in the same family as the alligator. The car is not named after the Cayman Islands; rather the islands also derive their name from the caiman. When the first Caymans arrived at dealerships for sale, the automaker adopted four caimans at Stuttgart's Wilhelma Zoo.[5]\nPorsche brought an infringement lawsuit in 2009 against Crocs, the maker of the popular rubber shoes. At issue was the footwear company's clog name also called Cayman. An injunction was granted against Crocs Europe, a division of the Longmont, Colorado-based shoe company preventing their use in Germany of the Cayman name.[6]\nIntroduced in 2016 for the 2017 model year, the Porsche Boxster and Cayman were renamed the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman, reviving the historic 718 moniker while switching engines from naturally-aspirated flat sixes to small-displacement flat-four turbocharged units. The new 718 Cayman was also repositioned with an entry price lower than that of the 718 Boxster, in keeping with Porsche's higher pricing for roadster models.[7]\nGrant Larson's design, inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder, stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche. Through consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs.[8] Many believe the introduction of the Boxster helped save Porsche from acquisition.\nBy October 1991 following a visit to the Tokyo Motor Show, Porsche in dire straits, began to devise solutions to succeed the poor selling 928 and incoming 968 (a heavy update of 944). In February 1992, Porsche began development of a successor to the 928 (mildly updated for 1992) and recently released 968. By June 1992, out of 4 proposals based on dual collaboration between 986 and 996 (993 successor) design teams, a proposal by Grant Larson and Pinky Lai was chosen by Harm Lagaay. In August 1992, a decision was made to develop the concept into a show vehicle, in time for the 1993 North American International Auto Show. After garnering widespread acclaim from the press and public upon presentation of the Boxster Concept in January 1993, the final production 986 production exterior design by Larson was frozen in March 1993. However, by the second half of 1993, difficulties arose with fitment of some components, resulting in lengthening of the hood and requiring another design freeze by fourth quarter of that year. Prototypes in 968 bodies were built to test mid-engine power train of the 986 by the end of 1993, with proper prototypes surfacing in 1994. Pilot production began in the second half of 1995, ahead of series production in mid-1996.\nThe Boxster was released ahead of its big brother, the 996. The 986 Boxster had the same bonnet, front wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture as the 996.\nAll 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed (\"flat\"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines had a number of failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast at the same time as the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.\nThe model received a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the front headlight's amber indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available.\n\nThe second generation of the Boxster (internally known as the 987) made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the new 911 (997). The car became available in 2005.\nIn appearance the car remains very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche's mid-engined supercar. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19\u00a0inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor.[citation needed] The base engine is a 2.7\u00a0L 176\u00a0kW (240\u00a0hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2\u00a0L 206\u00a0kW (280\u00a0hp) engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coup\u00e9 is derived from the 987.\nFor 2007 the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a 5\u00a0hp (3.7\u00a0kW) boost (245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S engine was upgraded from 3.2L to 3.4L, resulting in the production of 15\u00a0hp (11\u00a0kW) more (295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.\n\nPorsche first revealed the facelifted 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. Both models feature greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche's new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster's flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from 245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) to 255\u00a0hp (190\u00a0kW). Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from 295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) to 310\u00a0hp (230\u00a0kW). Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated day time running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.[9]\nAfter two years of development, the first model of the fastback coup\u00e9 to be released was the Cayman S (type 987120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling took place at the September Frankfurt Motor Show. The S suffix (for Sport[10] or Special[11]) indicated that this was a higher performance version of a then unreleased normal model. That model, the Cayman (987110), went on sale in July 2006. A motorsport-tuned model, the Cayman RS, was rumored to have been tested at the N\u00fcrburgring that same year.[12]\nThe Cayman fastback coup\u00e9 (project 987c) and the second generation Boxster roadster (project 987) shared the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman's body incorporates styling cues from classic Porsches; 356/1, the 550 Coup\u00e9 and the 904 Coup\u00e9.[13][14] Unlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a hatchback for access to luggage areas on top of and in the back of the engine cover. The entire aft portion of the Cayman is made from stainless steel. The suspension design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster with revised settings due to the stiffer chassis with the car's fixed roof.\nThe 3.4-litre flat-6 boxer engine (M97.21) in the first generation Cayman S was derived from the 3.2-litre (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, with cylinder heads from the Porsche 997 S's 3.8-litre motor (M97.01), which have the VarioCam Plus inlet valve timing and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7-litre M97.20, powered the base model. The use of these engines exclusively in Caymans ended in MY 2007 when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987310) and Boxster S (987320).[15]\nA 5-speed manual transaxle is standard on the Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual (Getrag 466) is the default for the S (G87.21) and an option on the base (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transaxle (Tiptronic) was also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replaced this option with a seven-speed \"PDK\", Porsche's dual-clutch robotic manual transmission). Other options include active shock absorbers (ThyssenKrupp Bilstein GmbH's DampTronic, rebadged as PASM by Porsche), ceramic disc brakes (PCCB), xenon headlights (Hella's Bi-Xenon) and an electronically controlled sport mode (Sport Chrono Package).\nThe first generation Cayman ceased production in November 2011.[16]\nA facelifted version of the Porsche Cayman was introduced on 21 February 2009. The standard Cayman engine's displacement was increased from 2.7 L to 2.9 L, giving a 20\u00a0hp (15\u00a0kW) increase to 265\u00a0hp (198\u00a0kW), while the Cayman S gained direct injection and a 25\u00a0hp (19\u00a0kW) increase to 320\u00a0hp (239\u00a0kW). The new engines no longer had the Intermediate Shaft, which proved to be a weak link in pre-2009 engines, the new engine nomenclature is 9A1. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintained a 10\u00a0hp (7\u00a0kW) power advantage over their roadster sibling, the Boxster. Each has its own design for the front bumper. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman\u2019s are arranged like the face of dice{[17]} while the Boxster gets a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission for the new model. The PDK outperforms the manual transmission with a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 5.1 seconds versus 5.2 seconds for the manual. The PDK with the sport button option lowers the 0-60\u00a0mph time to 4.9 seconds.[18]\nAlso a limited slip differential is now a factory option.[19]\nThe third-generation Boxster was announced on 13 March 2012 at the Geneva Auto Show with sales starting early summer 2012. The new Boxster reflects the new design language from the 911 (991) and 918, and features new and revised engine and transmission specifications. Together with a new body, the type 981 Boxster features a new chassis; 40 per cent more torsionally rigid, the front track is 40mm wider, the rear 18mm wider and the wheelbase extended by 60mm, but with a small weight reduction of up to 35 kilograms (77\u00a0lb) compared to the previous type 987 Boxster.[20]\nThe standard Boxster is fitted with a new 2.7-litre flat-6 engine, and the Boxster S is fitted with the existing 3.4-litre engine but with revised performance. Both engines are equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox and an optional 7-speed reworked PDK. Both manual and automatic models are available with several technical options including Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a Sport Chrono Package that includes active transmission mounts, and makes the PDK-equipped model even faster. Porsche claims that the new generation Boxster provides fuel savings of 15% over the outgoing model.\nThe range was expanded in March 2014 with the addition of the GTS derivative, with slightly altered front and rear bumpers and an additional 15\u00a0bhp from the 3.4-litre engine.[21]\nThe second generation Cayman was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The production 981 was released as a 2014 model in the spring of 2013. The new car was available in both the standard trim with a 2.7 L engine, and in the S trim with a 3.4 L engine. Both versions are available with either a 6-speed manual or a dual-clutch 7-speed PDK transmission.\nThe 981 features upgrades including a new body, a longer wheelbase, a wider front track, and a redesigned interior that matches the firm's contemporary 911 models.\nThe new model gained acclaim in the motoring press as one of the best handling sports cars at any price, due to its-mid engine layout and driving dynamics. The Cayman S benefits from the same engine and running gear as Porsche's latest 3.4 L version of the 911.\n[22][23][24][25]\nWith the new 982-generation, the marketing designation of the Boxster and Cayman was changed to Porsche 718, a nod to Porsche's racing heritage that won the Targa Florio race in 1959 and 1960. Because the 718 Cayman / Boxster has lost two cylinders, going from a naturally aspirated flat-6 engine to a turbocharged flat-4 engine, the name is meant to evoke a racing series that was won by a light car that outmaneuvered the cars with more powerful engines.[26][27]\nThe timeline of the 718 release started in 2016, with first model availability scheduled for June . The 718 base featured two new horizontally-opposed flat-4 turbocharged engines at 2.0L and 2.5L displacement with increased torque and horsepower with lower fuel consumption. The S model turbocharger utilizes Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) technology.[28][29] Later, In October 2017 the GTS models were announced with their 2.5l engines upgraded to produce 361 bhp. The Boxster could reach 60 mph in 4.1 seconds, and the Cayman in 3.9 seconds.[30]\nThe exterior of the 718 Boxster and Cayman is very similar to the third generation, in fact more of an evolution than a redesign. The most notable changes are to the rear of the car, which now has a long black-trim bar across the rear connecting the two taillights. The headlights and bumper are also heavily reworked. On the sides, the mirrors have been redesigned, taking hue from the SportDesign mirrors on the GT3.\nThe interior remains very similar to the 981 Cayman / Boxster and the 991.2 generation of the Porsche 911. The main change is the new PCM 4.0 infotainment system, which replaces the PCM 3.1.[31] The steering wheel comes with a mode selector switch that includes a selection of Sports and Sports Plus driving modes, resulting in snappier throttle response at the cost of fuel efficiency. Overall, the most prominent design features of the 981 Cayman / Boxster remain, including large air induction ports on the side, and the prominent horizontal aluminum piece used for adding oil and coolant in the trunk.[32]\nDespite the loss of two cylinders, the 718 Cayman / Boxster are mechanically superior to the 981 model. Acceleration is faster, and steering is improved.[33] The 718 Cayman was declared Motor Trend's 2nd best Drivers car in 2017, which praised the car's handling and throttle response. Giving the award, Miguel Cortina noted, \"The suspension is just what you want to feel in a car like this\u2014stiff, sporty, rigid. You get a very good sense of what is happening on the road.\"[34]\nThe Boxster and Cayman received a number of international and regional awards:\nThe 986 Boxster as well as 987 Boxster and Cayman have been plagued by catastrophic engine failures.[61] Porsche settled a class-action lawsuit regarding the failures in 2013.[62]\nSome Boxster models manufactured between 4 May 2001 and 21 February 2005 have suffered catastrophic engine failure due to a fault with the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing, which has resulted in a class action lawsuit against Porsche Cars North America (referred to as Eisen v. Porsche Cars North America). A settlement was agreed in March 2013, subject to court approval. Other types of engine failure experienced in the Boxster are not addressed by this suit. Additionally, the issues are not limited to the model years covered in the suit, or to the Boxster; the Cayman and 911 share the same type of engine and are also affected.  In fact, all model years of Boxster, Cayman and 911 manufactured between 1997 and 2008 (with the exception of the 996 and 997 turbo models) are subject to the now-notorious IMS bearing failure.\n", "Porsche Carrera 6": "The Porsche 906 or Carrera 6 is a street-legal racing car from Porsche. It was announced in January 1966 and 50 examples were subsequently produced, thus meeting the homologation requirements of the FIA's new Group 4 Sports Car category to the letter.[1] The type would also compete in modified form in the Group 6 Sports Prototype class.\nBuilt as a successor to the Porsche 904, and designed under Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch's new regime at Porsche R&D, the 906 replaced the boxed steel structure of the 904 which used the fiberglass body for extra structural strength with a tubular space frame and unstressed fiberglass body.[2] The fiberglass itself was laid up by hand, producing consistent results, instead of the uneven spraying technique used on the 904.\nThe result was a car that weighed 580\u00a0kg (1,280\u00a0lb), approximately 113\u00a0kg (250\u00a0lb) lighter than the 904/6 (the 6-cylinder 904). The engine regularly fitted was the 901/20 6-cylinder lightweight racing engine with 220\u00a0hp and carburetors, although some examples that were raced by the factory team received fuel-injected or 8-cylinder engines,[2] especially in hillclimbing events where Porsche competed with Ferrari Dinos for the European championship.[citation needed]\nIn its debut in the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona, the Carrera 6 finished 6th overall, and won its class against Ferrari Dino 206 Ps.[2] At the 12 Hours of Sebring, Hans Herrmann/Herbert M\u00fcller finished fourth overall and won the class, as at the 1000\u00a0km of Monza.\n906s recorded class victories at the 1000 km Spa and the 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring, and Willy Mairesse/Gerhard M\u00fcller, driving a privately entered 906, secured an overall victory at the 1966 Targa Florio when the factory cars failed.[2]\nAt the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 906 placed 4-5-6-7 behind three Ford GT40 Mk IIs, outlasting all of the previously dominant V12-engined Ferrari Ps.[2]\nUnlike previous racing Porsches, the 906's body was tested in a wind tunnel, resulting in a top speed of 280\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) at Le Mans, quite fast for a 2-liter engine car. At the time it showed a close resemblance to future Porsche racing cars. As in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, gull-wing doors were fitted, and the mid-ship mounted engine was covered with a large plexiglas cover.\nIn order to save money, spare suspension components produced in advance for a possible new series of Porsche 904 had to be used for the 906, along with big 15-inch wheels. Yet, Formula One used lighter 13-inch wheels, and Porsche had already used Team Lotus suspension parts in earlier years. The wheels were bolted on with 5 nuts as in a road car, which cost time in pitstops compared to a single central nut.\nTo take advantage of the lighter wheels and F1 tyres, the Porsche 910 was developed and entered in mid-season of 1966, starting with the hillclimb from Sierre to Crans-Montana in Switzerland.[citation needed]\n\n", "Porsche Carrera GT": "The Porsche Carrera GT (Project Code 980) is a mid-engined[4] sports car that was manufactured by Porsche between 2004\u20132007 in Leipzig, Germany.[5] Sports Car International named the Carrera GT number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 2000s, and number eight on Top Sports Cars of All Time list. For its advanced technology and development of its chassis the Popular Science magazine granted the \"Best of What's New\" award in 2003.[6]\nThe development of the Carrera GT can be traced back to the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98 racing cars. Due in part to the FIA and ACO rule changes in 1998, both designs had ended.  Porsche at the time had planned on a new Le Mans prototype for 1999.\nThe car was initially intended to use a turbocharged flat-6, but was later redesigned to use a new V10 engine, pushing the project back to planned completion in 2000. The V10 was a unit secretly built by Porsche for the Footwork Formula One team in 1992, but later shelved. The engine was resurrected for the Le Mans prototype and increased in size to 5.7 litres.\nThe project was canceled after two days of testing for the first car, in mid-1999, mostly due to Porsche's wish to build the Cayenne SUV with involvement from Volkswagen and Audi, thus requiring engineering expertise to be pulled from the motorsports division. It was also speculated that VW-Audi chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch wanted Audi's new Le Mans Prototype, the Audi R8 not to face competition from Porsche in 2004.\nPorsche did keep part of the project alive by using the 5.5\u00a0L V10 from the prototype in a concept car shown at the 2000 Paris Motor Show, mainly in an attempt to draw attention to their display. Surprising interest in the vehicle and an influx of revenue provided from the Cayenne helped Porsche decide to produce the car, and development started on a road-legal version that would be produced in small numbers at Porsche's new manufacturing facility in Leipzig. Porsche started a production run of Carrera GTs in 2004, shipping the units with an MSRP of US$448,000. The first Carrera GT went on sale in the United States on January 31, 2004.\nOriginally a production run of 1,500 cars was planned. However, Porsche announced in August 2005 that it would not continue production of the Carrera GT through to 2006, citing discontinuation was due to changing airbag regulations in the United States. By the end of production on May 6, 2006, more than 1,270 GTs had been sold, with a total of 644 units sold in the United States and 31 units sold in Canada.[7] In the United Kingdom, 49 units were sold.[8]\nThe Carrera GT is powered by a 5.7 litre V10 engine producing 450\u00a0kW (603\u00a0hp),[9] whereas the original concept car featured a 5.5 litre version rated at 416\u00a0kW (558\u00a0hp).  Porsche claimed the car would accelerate from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.5\u00a0seconds with a maximum speed of 330\u00a0km/h (205\u00a0mph).[5] A road test in June 2004 by Car and Driver showed that the car can accelerate from 0-60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.5\u00a0seconds,[9] 0-100\u00a0mph (161\u00a0km/h) in 6.8 seconds[9] and 0-130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) in 10.8 seconds.[9]\nThe Carrera GT was offered with a basic five-colour paint scheme which includes Guards Red, Fayence Yellow, Basalt Black, GT Silver metallic and Seal Grey. Custom colours were later available from the factory. A traditional six-speed manual transmission is the only available transmission.\nThe Carrera GT has large side inlets and air dams that help cool the large V10 engine framed by the carbon fibre rear bonnet. Fitted with Porsche's latest Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite brake system, the 15-inch (380\u00a0mm) SGL Carbon disc brakes make an impressive appearance underneath the 19\u00a0inch front and 20\u00a0inch rear 5-spoke alloy wheels. Similar to other Porsche models, such as the 911, the GT includes an electronically operated rear wing which deploys at speeds above 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).\nThe interior is trimmed in soft leather. Bose audio system and a navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is to the left of the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start the car with the left hand and put it in gear with the right. Originally, the car had a beechwood gearknob, which pays homage to the wooden gearknob used in the Porsche 917 Le Mans race car. In its second year of production, a carbon fibre knob was also made available.\nSport Auto tested a maximal lateral acceleration of 1.35 g, even 1.4 g was reached at the Schwalbenschwanz section of the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife, Motor Trend tested 11.1s@133.4\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) for the 1/4 mile.[16][10]\nNotable technology includes a pure carbon fibre  monocoque and subframe produced by ATR Composites Group of Italy, dry sump lubrication and inboard suspension. At speeds above 70\u00a0mph (113\u00a0km/h), the Carrera GT raises its rear wing into the airstream to reduce lift. Its radiator is about five times the size of that of a 911 Turbo of its time. The car's front and rear suspension system consists of pushrod actuated shock absorbers and dampers with anti-roll bars.\n", "Porsche Carrera GTS": "The Porsche 904 is an automobile which was produced by Porsche in Germany in 1964 and 1965. It was officially called Porsche Carrera GTS due to the same naming rights problem that required renaming the Porsche 901 to Porsche 911.\nAfter having withdrawn from Formula One at the end of the 1962 season, Porsche focused again on sportscar racing. The 904 debuted late in 1963, for the 1964 racing season,[1] as a successor to the 718, which had been introduced in 1957. Porsche designed the GTS variant to compete in the FIA-GT class at various international racing events. The street-legal version debuted in 1964 in order to comply with group 3 appendix J[2] homologation regulations requiring a certain number of road-going variants be sold by the factory. Porsche produced one-hundred and six 904s at four or five a day[3] with a list price of US$7245 (FOB Stuttgart).[4] Orders far exceeded the one hundred car requirement to satisfy homologation rules and more cars could have been sold.[3] The 904 marked the beginning of a series of sportscars that culminated in the dominant 917.\nThe 904's mid-engine layout was inherited from the 718, also known as the RSK (Rennsport = racing, kurz = short), the factory's leading race car. It was powered by the 1,966\u00a0cc (120\u00a0cu\u00a0in) Type 587/3,[4] four-cam flat four-cylinder engine producing 198\u00a0hp (148\u00a0kW), \"probably the most complex four-cylinder\" ever.[5] It drove a five-speed transmission with a standard 4.428:1 final drive, with available 4.605, 4.260, 3.636, and 3.362 ratios.[4]\nBegun as the Type 547, its development began in 1953, when the previous VW-based 1,100\u00a0cc (67\u00a0cu\u00a0in) flat-four, used in the contemporary 356 and rated at 38\u00a0hp (28\u00a0kW), hit the limit of its potential.[4] Porsche realized it needed something all-new.[2] The brainchild of  Ernst Fuhrmann, later technical director, it was hoped to achieve an \"unheard of\" 70\u00a0hp (52\u00a0kW) per 1\u00a0l (61\u00a0cu\u00a0in),[4] relying on hemispherical combustion chambers (which would be called hemis in the U.S.) and 46\u00a0mm (1.8\u00a0in)-throat 46IDA2 two-choke[6] Weber carburetors to generate 112\u00a0hp (84\u00a0kW) from the 1,500\u00a0cc (92\u00a0cu\u00a0in) four-cam engine.[4] The 1.5 liter weighed 310\u00a0lb (140\u00a0kg) dry, eventually producing 180\u00a0hp (134\u00a0kW). A complex design that proved \"very taxing\" to build and assemble,[4] but very durable, it was used in 34 different models, including 550 spyders, 356 Carreras, and F2/1s.[4]\nThe 904 was the first Porsche to use a ladder chassis[5] and fibreglass body,[5] appearing more like a specialist racing car than the modified sports cars typical at the time,[4] and was painted white. The fibreglass body was bonded to its steel chassis for extra rigidity, and achieved a drag coefficient of 0.34.[4] While many German race cars had used unpainted aluminium bodies since the famous 1934 Silver Arrows, most 904s were painted silver, the modern German national racing color. Unusually for Porsche, the two-seater bodies were provided by contractors, which would later become standard practice among race car builders.[3] The 904's fibreglass body was made by spraying chopped fibreglass into a mold, the amount sprayed often varied in thickness over the shape of the car and as a result the weight of the various cars was somewhat inconsistent. Race-prepared four-cylinder 904s weighed in at approximately 1,443 pounds (655\u00a0kg) and the low weight gave the 904 the ability to accelerate to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) from a standstill in less than six seconds (using the standard rear gear, which was typical at Sebring)[4] and to reach a top speed of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) (with the 3.362 ratio).[3] Frontal area was only 14\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1.3\u00a0m2).[3]\nThe Porsche 904 rode on coil springs (the first Porsche not to use trailing arm front and swingaxle rear suspension),[5] with unequal-length A-arms in front.[5] The wheelbase was 90.5\u00a0in (2,300\u00a0mm)[3] (by contrast, the Corvair's was 108\u00a0in (2,700\u00a0mm)),[7] track front and rear 51.7\u00a0in (1,310\u00a0mm),[3] height 42\u00a0in (1,100\u00a0mm), and ground clearance of 4.7\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) on 15\u00a0in (380\u00a0mm) wheels.  Brakes were 275\u00a0mm (10.8\u00a0in) discs at thefront and 285\u00a0mm (11.2\u00a0in) at the rear.\n\nTo satisfy demand, forty 1965 models were produced, some featuring a variant of the 911's flat-six. Due to the weight issues of the first generation plastic body, the 904's successor, the 1966 906 or \"Carrera 6\", was developed with a tubular space frame covered with an unstressed, lighter fiberglass body.A few factory race cars were fitted with a flat eight-cylinder power plant derived from the 1962 804 F1 car, the 225\u00a0hp (168\u00a0kW) 1,962\u00a0cc (119.7\u00a0cu\u00a0in) Type 771,[4] which used 42\u00a0mm (1.7\u00a0in)-throat downdraft Weber carburetors.[8] The Type 771s, however, suffered a \"disturbing habit\" of making their flywheels explode.[8]\n\nFor the European Hill Climb Championship in 1965, Porsche developed a successor to the 1964 Porsche 718 RS 61 Spyder. The 904 Bergspyder, based on the Coup\u00e9 904/8,[9] was given chassis numbers that began with the 906.[10] Therefore, the car is also sometimes called the 906/8 Bergspyder,[9] Although the race car was most commonly known as the 904 Bergspyder and was technically based on the 904 coupe.From the coupe, the developers carried over the steel box frame and put on a light open plastic body. The Bergspyder was not a beauty and visually showed no relationship to the aerodynamic coupe.[9] The car was flat especially shorter at the front and because of the missing roof and the shorter windshield as the series 904. However, this made the car around 120 kg lighter than the coupe, with a weight of 570 kg.[9]\nDuring the European Championship season 1965, the body was changed several times. For example, the windshield on model number 906 004 was shortened and flattened.[11] Later, the Bergspyder received again a lighter and rounded at the front and aerodynamically improved car body.[12]\nA total of five copies were produced, of which three were destroyed in accidents.[10] In the European Hill Climb Championship, Gerhard Mitter piloted the Bergspyder to an overall victory at the hill climb Rossfeld in 1965.[13] The 904 Bergspyder was replaced at the end of 1965 at the hill climb Ollon-Villars by the Porsche 906 Spyder Mountain.[14]\nThe chassis and suspension were taken over without major changes from the 904 coupe.[10] Due to the low weight and the unadjusted suspension of the 904, the Bergspyder was very difficult to drive.[9]\nThe Bergspyder is powered by the air-cooled 2-liter eight-cylinder boxer engine used in the type 771. This engine had its first use in 1962 in the Porsche 718 RS 61 [21] and already had a Bosch injection system for mixture preparation.[14] The valves were operated by two overhead camshafts with vertical shaft drive.[15] The engine delivered up to 191 kW (260 hp) at 8,800 rpm and had a compression ratio of 10.5: 1. The car a top speed of around 260 km/h (161 mph).[9]\nModern day replicas of the 904 are currently being produced by a number of companies, including Martin and Walker[16] in the UK and Chuck Beck [17] in the US.\nMaking an inauspicious debut at Sebring in 1964, where it suffered clutch trouble,[4] \"a four-cylinder 904 took an astounding first overall\" at the Targa Florio.[4] It went on to a third at the N\u00fcrburgring and a perfect finish at LeMans. Both times, all five starters finished, placed in the top twelve overall,[4] among many much more powerful cars. 904s showed remarkable durability; they \"almost always\" finished,[8] and at Reims in 1964, a customer car fresh from Stuttgart, driven to the track, went on to win without the need for any spares at all.[3] For 1964, 904s racked up a 1-2 at the Targa Florio and class wins at Spa, Sebring (co-driven by Briggs Cunningham and Lake Underwood), the N\u00fcrburgring, Le Mans, Watkins Glen, Zandvoort, Canada, and the Paris 1000 Kilometer, in the process taking SCCA's C-Production and E-Sports Racing titles.[8] In addition, it won rally events including the Tulip, Munich-Vienna-Budapest, Geneva, and \"highly acclaimed\" Alpine Rally.[8] For 1965, results were \"equally impressive\", seeing wins at the Spanish, Rossfeld, Hellbronner, and Gaisburg rallies, as well as a class win and second overall in the Monte Carlo Rally which saw just 22 finishers in the points, out of 237 starters.[8] In addition, 904s won their class at the Monza 1000 Kilometer, Targa, Spa, Daytona Continental, Le Mans, and Zandvoort, among others, repeating their E-Sports title win and adding an SCCA E-Production championship.[8]\n\n", "Porsche Cayenne": "The Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury crossover sport utility vehicle produced by the German manufacturer Porsche since 2002, with North American sales beginning in 2003. It is the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off road variant vehicle since its Super and Junior tractors of 1950s, and the first Porsche with four doors. Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology.\nThe second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March following an online reveal. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. The second generation received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version, with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show.[2]\nThe Porsche Cayenne entered the market with mixed anticipation. However, it soon proved that it was the performance vehicle among SUVs and was praised for its excellent handling and powerful engines.[3] The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo. Later in the model cycle, VR6 and diesel-powered versions joined the lineup.\nThe base model is powered by a 3.2-L VR6 engine producing 250\u00a0PS (184\u00a0kW); modifications in the exhaust manifold allow power to peak at 6700 rpm. Acceleration from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km) is approx 7.5 seconds with manual transmission and 8.1 seconds with the Tiptronic S.\nThe S is powered by an 8-cylinder engine with a dry-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing. The Cayenne S engine produces 340\u00a0PS (250\u00a0kW) and 310\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (420\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque. Acceleration from 0\u201360\u00a0mph is 7.1 seconds and the top speed is 150\u00a0mph.[4]\nIntroduced only for 2006 (Pre-GTS concept), a special distinctive Cayenne S Titanium Edition Wagon (9PA), a 1 Year exclusive, limited production SUV featuring a lightweight steel body (it is lighter than the Cayenne S), titanium-painted accented body parts, side lower rocker body panels, 4 sports chrome tailpipes, 19\" titanium painted alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, two-tone interior upholstery, Porsche PCM w/ trip computer navigation, MP3 audio and Bose cabin surround sound. Exhaust tone is aggressive and deep, even at idle. This sporty design S(Ti) is also powered by an alloy 4.5L V8  engine with a dry-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing.   The Cayenne S(Ti) engine produces healthy 340 PS (250 kW) and 310 lb\u00b7ft (420 N\u00b7m) of torque. Acceleration is quicker from 0\u201360 mph at sub 6.8 seconds and the top speed is 150+ mph. It featured sport tuned suspension, and includes a low-range case, a locking differential and six-speed automatic Tiptronic transmission (See Turbo & Turbo S).[3]\nThe GTS is powered with a 405\u00a0PS (298\u00a0kW) 4.8-L V8 and features a sport suspension and 21-inch (530\u00a0mm) wheels. It is lighter than the Cayenne S and has an aerodynamic body kit. The Porsche Cayenne GTS has a 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) time of 5.7 seconds. A six-speed manual transmission is also offered.[5]\nThe first-generation Cayenne Turbo had 450\u00a0PS (331\u00a0kW), and accelerated from 0 to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) in 5.3 seconds.[4] A Turbo S version was built in 2006 to compete with the Mercedes-Benz ML 63 AMG. The Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S included a low-range case, a locking differential, and the height-adjustable, off-road suspension. The S was powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.5-L V8 that produced 521\u00a0PS (383\u00a0kW) and 720\u00a0N\u22c5m (530\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque; Acceleration from 0\u201360\u00a0mph (96\u00a0km/h) was 5.0 seconds and the top speed was 171 miles per hour; It featured a six-speed automatic Tiptronic transmission.\nIn 2008 an updated Turbo model, featuring a larger 4.8-L engine, was revealed at the Beijing auto show. It produced 50\u00a0PS (37\u00a0kW) more power, and now accelerated from 0\u201360\u00a0mph (96\u00a0km/h) in 4.9 seconds.[6] Also revealed with the new Turbo was a new 550-horsepower (410\u00a0kW) Turbo S. Acceleration from 0\u201360\u00a0mph is 4.7 seconds and it has optional ceramic composite brakes.\nPorsche has sold a diesel version of the Cayenne powered by a 3.0-L V6 VW TDI engine since February 2009.[7] The engine is rated at 240\u00a0PS (177\u00a0kW; 237\u00a0hp) and 550\u00a0N\u22c5m (410\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque. The car was unveiled in 2009 Geneva Motor Show.[8] The diesel can accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 9.2 seconds.\nOriginally a racing vehicle for Transsyberia rally, only 26 were built.[9]\nThe street version was later built to commemorate Porsche's victory in Transsyberia rally. It is a variant with the 405\u00a0hp (302\u00a0kW) direct-inject 4.8-L V8 from the Cayenne GTS. Sales began in January 2009, with a production run of 600 road vehicles.[10]\nIn May 2009,[11] a limited edition version based on Cayenne GTS was introduced, designed by Porsche Design Studio and included a Porsche Design chronograph Type P\u20196612. Production was limited to 1000 units, 100 in the USA.[12]\nThe second-generation Porsche Cayenne went on sale in April\u2013May 2010 as a 2011 model, with an official debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. In preparation for the unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 to commence factory retooling for the new model, a process that took 2\u20133 months.[citation needed]\nThe 2011 Porsche Cayenne is larger than its predecessors, but features a more slanted rear window, less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows at the rear of the vehicle, headlights inspired by the Carrera GT, taillights that extend onto the car's tailgate, LED daytime running lights and a vastly redesigned interior modeled after the Panamera.[15] The 2011 Cayenne is almost 250\u00a0kg (550\u00a0lb) lighter than the previous models due to extensive use of aluminum and magnesium, making it more fuel efficient than the previous lineup.[16] Despite its lower stance, the new vehicle's off-road capabilities have been retained without compromising the street performance-oriented layout and design.[citation needed]. In addition to a diesel offering, a hybrid version is available.[17] Also, model year 2013 - 2016 diesel Porsche Cayennes are included in the Volkswagen emissions scandal.\nStandard features of the 2011 Porsche Cayenne include air conditioning with dual-zone climate controls, interior air filter, tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, eight-way power front seats, outside-temperature indicator, and universal garage door opener in the base model. The Cayenne S adds a power sunroof and memory for the driver's seat.[16] The Cayenne GTS added an optional rearview camera, keyless access and start, and memory system. Finally, the most upscale Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S added a navigation system with voice recognition, optional four-zone climate controls, heated rear seats, premium sound system with six-disc CD changer.[18]\nThe Cayenne's naturally aspirated and turbocharged V8 engines are shared with the Panamera and have been upgraded for faster acceleration times with more horsepower and torque, as well as more powerful direct-injection technology to improve efficiency. The base Cayenne model Cayenne is tuned to offer 300\u00a0hp.[citation needed]\nThe Cayenne comes powered by a 3.6-L VR6 engine producing 300\u00a0PS (221\u00a0kW; 296\u00a0hp), the Cayenne S features the same 4.8-L V8 in the Panamera S models producing 400\u00a0PS (294\u00a0kW; 395\u00a0hp) and the Cayenne Turbo comes with Panamera Turbo's 4.8-L twin turbo V8 producing 500\u00a0PS (368\u00a0kW; 493\u00a0hp).[16] The Cayenne S Hybrid uses an Volkswagen-sourced 3.0-L V6 engine producing 333\u00a0PS (245\u00a0kW; 328\u00a0hp) paired with a nickel metal hydride battery capable of 47\u00a0PS (35\u00a0kW; 46\u00a0hp) for a total of 380\u00a0PS (279\u00a0kW; 375\u00a0hp).[19] A manual gearbox serves as the standard transmission system on the base Cayenne, with all other models featuring an eight-speed Tiptronic as standard equipment. The low-range transfer case found in the previous generation has been removed. All vehicles will feature about 10% less weight than their predecessors, 70\u00a0kg worth of standard equipment in excess of that found on the current model and a more heavily contoured rear bench.[citation needed]\nAvailable Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active anti-roll bars,[20] Adaptive air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM).\nIn September 2012 Porsche announced the Cayenne S Diesel.[21] This model is fitted with the Volkswagen 4.1-L V8 TDI engine. In October 2012, Porsche confirmed the addition of a new Cayenne Turbo S.[22]\nIn July 2014, Porsche launched a facelifted Cayenne range, with minor exterior alterations and new power-train options, including a plug-in E-Hybrid and downsizing of the S model's 4.8-L V8 to a turbocharged 3.6-L V6.[citation needed]\nAt the IAA 2005, Porsche announced it would produce a hybrid version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). Two years later, at the IAA 2007, Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain.[citation needed]\nNotable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump, allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire.[23]\nThe production version, called the S Hybrid, was launched in 2010, with a 3.0-L petrol V6 linked with an electric motor to achieve CO2 emissions of 193 g/km.[24] The S Hybrid was launched in the U.S. market in November 2010.[25]\nIn July 2014, Porsche announced the launch of the Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range  between 18 and 36\u00a0km (11 and 22\u00a0mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. The plug-in model displaced the Cayenne S Hybrid from the line up, and it is part of the revised range. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid is the first plug-in hybrid in the premium SUV segment, allowing Porsche to become the first automaker with three production plug-in hybrid models.[26] Deliveries in Germany were scheduled to begin in October 2014.[27] Sales in the U.S. began in November 2014.[28]\nThe following are the official EPA ratings of the Cayenne S E-Hybrid compared with the others models of the 2015 line up available in the U.S.:\nOn 1 May 2017, a 2017 Porsche Cayenne S Diesel set the Guinness World Record for heaviest aircraft pulled by a production car. The Cayenne towed a 285 ton Air France Airbus A380 to a distance of 42 meters, breaking the previous 2013 record of a Nissan Patrol towing a 170 ton Ilyushin Il-76 to a distance of 50 meters.[30] After the attempt Porsche repeated the test using a petrol-powered Cayenne Turbo S with 800 Nm of torque, 50 Nm less than the S Diesel, in an effort to prove the Cayenne's remarkable ability.[31]\nThe third-generation Porsche Cayenne was revealed online on August 29, 2017 as a 2019 model, based on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform.[32]\n\nAll engines of the third generation models are turbocharged.[32]\n", "Porsche Cayman": "\nThe Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are mid-engined two-seater sports cars built by Porsche. There have been four generations; the first generation Boxster, a 2-door, 2-seater roadster was released in 1996. The Cayman, a 2-door, 2-seater fastback coup\u00e9 based on the second generation Boxster went on sale in late 2005. A third generation was released in 2012, and since the fourth generation of 2016, the two models have been marketed jointly as the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman. \nThe Porsche Boxster is a mid-engined two-seater roadster. It was Porsche's first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The first-generation Boxster (the 986) was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine. The design was heavily influenced by the 1992 Boxster Concept. In 2000, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine and the new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants.\nProduction of the 986 began at the former Porsche 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Boxster was Porsche's biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the company introduced the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003. As of September 2012, additional production of the 981 started at the former Karmann-factory in Osnabr\u00fcck.[2]\nIn 2005, Porsche unveiled the second generation of Boxster: the type 987. The 987 is more powerful than its predecessor and featured styling inspired by the Carrera GT. Engine output increased in 2007, when both Boxster models received the engines from their corresponding Porsche Cayman variants. In 2009, the Boxster models received several new cosmetic and mechanical upgrades, further increasing engine output and performance. The third generation Boxster (type 981) was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.\nThe Boxster's name is derived from the word \"boxer\", referring to the vehicle's flat or \"boxer\" engine, and the word \"roadster\", referring to the vehicle's two-seater capacity and convertible top.\nFirst launched in the 2006 model year, the Cayman is a coup\u00e9 derived from Porsche's second and third generation Boxster roadster. The designer of the first generation of Porsche Cayman was Pinky Lai. Like the Boxster, most Caymans were assembled in Finland for Porsche by Valmet Automotive (the rest were assembled in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart, Germany). Porsche's Deputy Chairman, Holger P. Haerter stated that the contract with Valmet Automotive will end in 2012, and the Cayman's production was to be outsourced to Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria.[3] However, as Volkswagen assumed control of Porsche AG, production of Caymans and Boxsters after 2012 began in the former Karmann plant in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, which is now owned by Volkswagen and also used for production of the 2012 Golf (Mk6) convertible.[4]\nCayman is an alternative spelling of caiman, a reptile in the same family as the alligator. The car is not named after the Cayman Islands; rather the islands also derive their name from the caiman. When the first Caymans arrived at dealerships for sale, the automaker adopted four caimans at Stuttgart's Wilhelma Zoo.[5]\nPorsche brought an infringement lawsuit in 2009 against Crocs, the maker of the popular rubber shoes. At issue was the footwear company's clog name also called Cayman. An injunction was granted against Crocs Europe, a division of the Longmont, Colorado-based shoe company preventing their use in Germany of the Cayman name.[6]\nIntroduced in 2016 for the 2017 model year, the Porsche Boxster and Cayman were renamed the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman, reviving the historic 718 moniker while switching engines from naturally-aspirated flat sixes to small-displacement flat-four turbocharged units. The new 718 Cayman was also repositioned with an entry price lower than that of the 718 Boxster, in keeping with Porsche's higher pricing for roadster models.[7]\nGrant Larson's design, inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder, stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche. Through consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs.[8] Many believe the introduction of the Boxster helped save Porsche from acquisition.\nBy October 1991 following a visit to the Tokyo Motor Show, Porsche in dire straits, began to devise solutions to succeed the poor selling 928 and incoming 968 (a heavy update of 944). In February 1992, Porsche began development of a successor to the 928 (mildly updated for 1992) and recently released 968. By June 1992, out of 4 proposals based on dual collaboration between 986 and 996 (993 successor) design teams, a proposal by Grant Larson and Pinky Lai was chosen by Harm Lagaay. In August 1992, a decision was made to develop the concept into a show vehicle, in time for the 1993 North American International Auto Show. After garnering widespread acclaim from the press and public upon presentation of the Boxster Concept in January 1993, the final production 986 production exterior design by Larson was frozen in March 1993. However, by the second half of 1993, difficulties arose with fitment of some components, resulting in lengthening of the hood and requiring another design freeze by fourth quarter of that year. Prototypes in 968 bodies were built to test mid-engine power train of the 986 by the end of 1993, with proper prototypes surfacing in 1994. Pilot production began in the second half of 1995, ahead of series production in mid-1996.\nThe Boxster was released ahead of its big brother, the 996. The 986 Boxster had the same bonnet, front wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture as the 996.\nAll 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed (\"flat\"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines had a number of failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast at the same time as the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.\nThe model received a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the front headlight's amber indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available.\n\nThe second generation of the Boxster (internally known as the 987) made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the new 911 (997). The car became available in 2005.\nIn appearance the car remains very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche's mid-engined supercar. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19\u00a0inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor.[citation needed] The base engine is a 2.7\u00a0L 176\u00a0kW (240\u00a0hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2\u00a0L 206\u00a0kW (280\u00a0hp) engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coup\u00e9 is derived from the 987.\nFor 2007 the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a 5\u00a0hp (3.7\u00a0kW) boost (245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S engine was upgraded from 3.2L to 3.4L, resulting in the production of 15\u00a0hp (11\u00a0kW) more (295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.\n\nPorsche first revealed the facelifted 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. Both models feature greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche's new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster's flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from 245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) to 255\u00a0hp (190\u00a0kW). Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from 295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) to 310\u00a0hp (230\u00a0kW). Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated day time running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.[9]\nAfter two years of development, the first model of the fastback coup\u00e9 to be released was the Cayman S (type 987120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling took place at the September Frankfurt Motor Show. The S suffix (for Sport[10] or Special[11]) indicated that this was a higher performance version of a then unreleased normal model. That model, the Cayman (987110), went on sale in July 2006. A motorsport-tuned model, the Cayman RS, was rumored to have been tested at the N\u00fcrburgring that same year.[12]\nThe Cayman fastback coup\u00e9 (project 987c) and the second generation Boxster roadster (project 987) shared the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman's body incorporates styling cues from classic Porsches; 356/1, the 550 Coup\u00e9 and the 904 Coup\u00e9.[13][14] Unlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a hatchback for access to luggage areas on top of and in the back of the engine cover. The entire aft portion of the Cayman is made from stainless steel. The suspension design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster with revised settings due to the stiffer chassis with the car's fixed roof.\nThe 3.4-litre flat-6 boxer engine (M97.21) in the first generation Cayman S was derived from the 3.2-litre (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, with cylinder heads from the Porsche 997 S's 3.8-litre motor (M97.01), which have the VarioCam Plus inlet valve timing and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7-litre M97.20, powered the base model. The use of these engines exclusively in Caymans ended in MY 2007 when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987310) and Boxster S (987320).[15]\nA 5-speed manual transaxle is standard on the Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual (Getrag 466) is the default for the S (G87.21) and an option on the base (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transaxle (Tiptronic) was also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replaced this option with a seven-speed \"PDK\", Porsche's dual-clutch robotic manual transmission). Other options include active shock absorbers (ThyssenKrupp Bilstein GmbH's DampTronic, rebadged as PASM by Porsche), ceramic disc brakes (PCCB), xenon headlights (Hella's Bi-Xenon) and an electronically controlled sport mode (Sport Chrono Package).\nThe first generation Cayman ceased production in November 2011.[16]\nA facelifted version of the Porsche Cayman was introduced on 21 February 2009. The standard Cayman engine's displacement was increased from 2.7 L to 2.9 L, giving a 20\u00a0hp (15\u00a0kW) increase to 265\u00a0hp (198\u00a0kW), while the Cayman S gained direct injection and a 25\u00a0hp (19\u00a0kW) increase to 320\u00a0hp (239\u00a0kW). The new engines no longer had the Intermediate Shaft, which proved to be a weak link in pre-2009 engines, the new engine nomenclature is 9A1. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintained a 10\u00a0hp (7\u00a0kW) power advantage over their roadster sibling, the Boxster. Each has its own design for the front bumper. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman\u2019s are arranged like the face of dice{[17]} while the Boxster gets a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission for the new model. The PDK outperforms the manual transmission with a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 5.1 seconds versus 5.2 seconds for the manual. The PDK with the sport button option lowers the 0-60\u00a0mph time to 4.9 seconds.[18]\nAlso a limited slip differential is now a factory option.[19]\nThe third-generation Boxster was announced on 13 March 2012 at the Geneva Auto Show with sales starting early summer 2012. The new Boxster reflects the new design language from the 911 (991) and 918, and features new and revised engine and transmission specifications. Together with a new body, the type 981 Boxster features a new chassis; 40 per cent more torsionally rigid, the front track is 40mm wider, the rear 18mm wider and the wheelbase extended by 60mm, but with a small weight reduction of up to 35 kilograms (77\u00a0lb) compared to the previous type 987 Boxster.[20]\nThe standard Boxster is fitted with a new 2.7-litre flat-6 engine, and the Boxster S is fitted with the existing 3.4-litre engine but with revised performance. Both engines are equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox and an optional 7-speed reworked PDK. Both manual and automatic models are available with several technical options including Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a Sport Chrono Package that includes active transmission mounts, and makes the PDK-equipped model even faster. Porsche claims that the new generation Boxster provides fuel savings of 15% over the outgoing model.\nThe range was expanded in March 2014 with the addition of the GTS derivative, with slightly altered front and rear bumpers and an additional 15\u00a0bhp from the 3.4-litre engine.[21]\nThe second generation Cayman was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The production 981 was released as a 2014 model in the spring of 2013. The new car was available in both the standard trim with a 2.7 L engine, and in the S trim with a 3.4 L engine. Both versions are available with either a 6-speed manual or a dual-clutch 7-speed PDK transmission.\nThe 981 features upgrades including a new body, a longer wheelbase, a wider front track, and a redesigned interior that matches the firm's contemporary 911 models.\nThe new model gained acclaim in the motoring press as one of the best handling sports cars at any price, due to its-mid engine layout and driving dynamics. The Cayman S benefits from the same engine and running gear as Porsche's latest 3.4 L version of the 911.\n[22][23][24][25]\nWith the new 982-generation, the marketing designation of the Boxster and Cayman was changed to Porsche 718, a nod to Porsche's racing heritage that won the Targa Florio race in 1959 and 1960. Because the 718 Cayman / Boxster has lost two cylinders, going from a naturally aspirated flat-6 engine to a turbocharged flat-4 engine, the name is meant to evoke a racing series that was won by a light car that outmaneuvered the cars with more powerful engines.[26][27]\nThe timeline of the 718 release started in 2016, with first model availability scheduled for June . The 718 base featured two new horizontally-opposed flat-4 turbocharged engines at 2.0L and 2.5L displacement with increased torque and horsepower with lower fuel consumption. The S model turbocharger utilizes Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) technology.[28][29] Later, In October 2017 the GTS models were announced with their 2.5l engines upgraded to produce 361 bhp. The Boxster could reach 60 mph in 4.1 seconds, and the Cayman in 3.9 seconds.[30]\nThe exterior of the 718 Boxster and Cayman is very similar to the third generation, in fact more of an evolution than a redesign. The most notable changes are to the rear of the car, which now has a long black-trim bar across the rear connecting the two taillights. The headlights and bumper are also heavily reworked. On the sides, the mirrors have been redesigned, taking hue from the SportDesign mirrors on the GT3.\nThe interior remains very similar to the 981 Cayman / Boxster and the 991.2 generation of the Porsche 911. The main change is the new PCM 4.0 infotainment system, which replaces the PCM 3.1.[31] The steering wheel comes with a mode selector switch that includes a selection of Sports and Sports Plus driving modes, resulting in snappier throttle response at the cost of fuel efficiency. Overall, the most prominent design features of the 981 Cayman / Boxster remain, including large air induction ports on the side, and the prominent horizontal aluminum piece used for adding oil and coolant in the trunk.[32]\nDespite the loss of two cylinders, the 718 Cayman / Boxster are mechanically superior to the 981 model. Acceleration is faster, and steering is improved.[33] The 718 Cayman was declared Motor Trend's 2nd best Drivers car in 2017, which praised the car's handling and throttle response. Giving the award, Miguel Cortina noted, \"The suspension is just what you want to feel in a car like this\u2014stiff, sporty, rigid. You get a very good sense of what is happening on the road.\"[34]\nThe Boxster and Cayman received a number of international and regional awards:\nThe 986 Boxster as well as 987 Boxster and Cayman have been plagued by catastrophic engine failures.[61] Porsche settled a class-action lawsuit regarding the failures in 2013.[62]\nSome Boxster models manufactured between 4 May 2001 and 21 February 2005 have suffered catastrophic engine failure due to a fault with the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing, which has resulted in a class action lawsuit against Porsche Cars North America (referred to as Eisen v. Porsche Cars North America). A settlement was agreed in March 2013, subject to court approval. Other types of engine failure experienced in the Boxster are not addressed by this suit. Additionally, the issues are not limited to the model years covered in the suit, or to the Boxster; the Cayman and 911 share the same type of engine and are also affected.  In fact, all model years of Boxster, Cayman and 911 manufactured between 1997 and 2008 (with the exception of the 996 and 997 turbo models) are subject to the now-notorious IMS bearing failure.\n", "Porsche Cayman GT4": "\nThe Porsche Boxster and Porsche Cayman are mid-engined two-seater sports cars built by Porsche. There have been four generations; the first generation Boxster, a 2-door, 2-seater roadster was released in 1996. The Cayman, a 2-door, 2-seater fastback coup\u00e9 based on the second generation Boxster went on sale in late 2005. A third generation was released in 2012, and since the fourth generation of 2016, the two models have been marketed jointly as the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman. \nThe Porsche Boxster is a mid-engined two-seater roadster. It was Porsche's first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The first-generation Boxster (the 986) was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine. The design was heavily influenced by the 1992 Boxster Concept. In 2000, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine and the new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants.\nProduction of the 986 began at the former Porsche 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Boxster was Porsche's biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the company introduced the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003. As of September 2012, additional production of the 981 started at the former Karmann-factory in Osnabr\u00fcck.[2]\nIn 2005, Porsche unveiled the second generation of Boxster: the type 987. The 987 is more powerful than its predecessor and featured styling inspired by the Carrera GT. Engine output increased in 2007, when both Boxster models received the engines from their corresponding Porsche Cayman variants. In 2009, the Boxster models received several new cosmetic and mechanical upgrades, further increasing engine output and performance. The third generation Boxster (type 981) was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.\nThe Boxster's name is derived from the word \"boxer\", referring to the vehicle's flat or \"boxer\" engine, and the word \"roadster\", referring to the vehicle's two-seater capacity and convertible top.\nFirst launched in the 2006 model year, the Cayman is a coup\u00e9 derived from Porsche's second and third generation Boxster roadster. The designer of the first generation of Porsche Cayman was Pinky Lai. Like the Boxster, most Caymans were assembled in Finland for Porsche by Valmet Automotive (the rest were assembled in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart, Germany). Porsche's Deputy Chairman, Holger P. Haerter stated that the contract with Valmet Automotive will end in 2012, and the Cayman's production was to be outsourced to Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria.[3] However, as Volkswagen assumed control of Porsche AG, production of Caymans and Boxsters after 2012 began in the former Karmann plant in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, which is now owned by Volkswagen and also used for production of the 2012 Golf (Mk6) convertible.[4]\nCayman is an alternative spelling of caiman, a reptile in the same family as the alligator. The car is not named after the Cayman Islands; rather the islands also derive their name from the caiman. When the first Caymans arrived at dealerships for sale, the automaker adopted four caimans at Stuttgart's Wilhelma Zoo.[5]\nPorsche brought an infringement lawsuit in 2009 against Crocs, the maker of the popular rubber shoes. At issue was the footwear company's clog name also called Cayman. An injunction was granted against Crocs Europe, a division of the Longmont, Colorado-based shoe company preventing their use in Germany of the Cayman name.[6]\nIntroduced in 2016 for the 2017 model year, the Porsche Boxster and Cayman were renamed the Porsche 718 Boxster and Porsche 718 Cayman, reviving the historic 718 moniker while switching engines from naturally-aspirated flat sixes to small-displacement flat-four turbocharged units. The new 718 Cayman was also repositioned with an entry price lower than that of the 718 Boxster, in keeping with Porsche's higher pricing for roadster models.[7]\nGrant Larson's design, inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder, stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche. Through consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs.[8] Many believe the introduction of the Boxster helped save Porsche from acquisition.\nBy October 1991 following a visit to the Tokyo Motor Show, Porsche in dire straits, began to devise solutions to succeed the poor selling 928 and incoming 968 (a heavy update of 944). In February 1992, Porsche began development of a successor to the 928 (mildly updated for 1992) and recently released 968. By June 1992, out of 4 proposals based on dual collaboration between 986 and 996 (993 successor) design teams, a proposal by Grant Larson and Pinky Lai was chosen by Harm Lagaay. In August 1992, a decision was made to develop the concept into a show vehicle, in time for the 1993 North American International Auto Show. After garnering widespread acclaim from the press and public upon presentation of the Boxster Concept in January 1993, the final production 986 production exterior design by Larson was frozen in March 1993. However, by the second half of 1993, difficulties arose with fitment of some components, resulting in lengthening of the hood and requiring another design freeze by fourth quarter of that year. Prototypes in 968 bodies were built to test mid-engine power train of the 986 by the end of 1993, with proper prototypes surfacing in 1994. Pilot production began in the second half of 1995, ahead of series production in mid-1996.\nThe Boxster was released ahead of its big brother, the 996. The 986 Boxster had the same bonnet, front wings, headlights, interior and engine architecture as the 996.\nAll 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed (\"flat\"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines had a number of failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast at the same time as the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.\nThe model received a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the front headlight's amber indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available.\n\nThe second generation of the Boxster (internally known as the 987) made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the new 911 (997). The car became available in 2005.\nIn appearance the car remains very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche's mid-engined supercar. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19\u00a0inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor.[citation needed] The base engine is a 2.7\u00a0L 176\u00a0kW (240\u00a0hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2\u00a0L 206\u00a0kW (280\u00a0hp) engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coup\u00e9 is derived from the 987.\nFor 2007 the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a 5\u00a0hp (3.7\u00a0kW) boost (245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S engine was upgraded from 3.2L to 3.4L, resulting in the production of 15\u00a0hp (11\u00a0kW) more (295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.\n\nPorsche first revealed the facelifted 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. Both models feature greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche's new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster's flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from 245\u00a0hp (183\u00a0kW) to 255\u00a0hp (190\u00a0kW). Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from 295\u00a0hp (220\u00a0kW) to 310\u00a0hp (230\u00a0kW). Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated day time running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.[9]\nAfter two years of development, the first model of the fastback coup\u00e9 to be released was the Cayman S (type 987120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling took place at the September Frankfurt Motor Show. The S suffix (for Sport[10] or Special[11]) indicated that this was a higher performance version of a then unreleased normal model. That model, the Cayman (987110), went on sale in July 2006. A motorsport-tuned model, the Cayman RS, was rumored to have been tested at the N\u00fcrburgring that same year.[12]\nThe Cayman fastback coup\u00e9 (project 987c) and the second generation Boxster roadster (project 987) shared the same mid-engined platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman's body incorporates styling cues from classic Porsches; 356/1, the 550 Coup\u00e9 and the 904 Coup\u00e9.[13][14] Unlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a hatchback for access to luggage areas on top of and in the back of the engine cover. The entire aft portion of the Cayman is made from stainless steel. The suspension design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster with revised settings due to the stiffer chassis with the car's fixed roof.\nThe 3.4-litre flat-6 boxer engine (M97.21) in the first generation Cayman S was derived from the 3.2-litre (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, with cylinder heads from the Porsche 997 S's 3.8-litre motor (M97.01), which have the VarioCam Plus inlet valve timing and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7-litre M97.20, powered the base model. The use of these engines exclusively in Caymans ended in MY 2007 when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987310) and Boxster S (987320).[15]\nA 5-speed manual transaxle is standard on the Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual (Getrag 466) is the default for the S (G87.21) and an option on the base (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transaxle (Tiptronic) was also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replaced this option with a seven-speed \"PDK\", Porsche's dual-clutch robotic manual transmission). Other options include active shock absorbers (ThyssenKrupp Bilstein GmbH's DampTronic, rebadged as PASM by Porsche), ceramic disc brakes (PCCB), xenon headlights (Hella's Bi-Xenon) and an electronically controlled sport mode (Sport Chrono Package).\nThe first generation Cayman ceased production in November 2011.[16]\nA facelifted version of the Porsche Cayman was introduced on 21 February 2009. The standard Cayman engine's displacement was increased from 2.7 L to 2.9 L, giving a 20\u00a0hp (15\u00a0kW) increase to 265\u00a0hp (198\u00a0kW), while the Cayman S gained direct injection and a 25\u00a0hp (19\u00a0kW) increase to 320\u00a0hp (239\u00a0kW). The new engines no longer had the Intermediate Shaft, which proved to be a weak link in pre-2009 engines, the new engine nomenclature is 9A1. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintained a 10\u00a0hp (7\u00a0kW) power advantage over their roadster sibling, the Boxster. Each has its own design for the front bumper. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman\u2019s are arranged like the face of dice{[17]} while the Boxster gets a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission for the new model. The PDK outperforms the manual transmission with a 0-60\u00a0mph time of 5.1 seconds versus 5.2 seconds for the manual. The PDK with the sport button option lowers the 0-60\u00a0mph time to 4.9 seconds.[18]\nAlso a limited slip differential is now a factory option.[19]\nThe third-generation Boxster was announced on 13 March 2012 at the Geneva Auto Show with sales starting early summer 2012.

Built by German Jochen Dauer's Dauer Racing, a racing version of this car went on to win the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans with the support of Porsche through the use of regulation loopholes.\nThe win in 1994 makes it the first GT1 sports car to finish 1st in the Le Mans event.\nThe first production car debuted at the 1993 Frankfurt Auto Show.[1]\nDauer Racing (now Dauer Sportwagen) produced the 962 Le Mans from stripped down Porsche 962 bodies for modification.[2]\nComponents of the bodywork were replaced with slightly revised carbon fibre and kevlar panels. The under tray was replaced with a flat version for better stability at high speeds.[3] A second seat and leather upholstery were installed in the cramped cockpit, as well as a video screen for DVD playback in later years.[1] A small compartment was added to the front of the car to carry luggage. A hydraulic suspension system was also added to meet German ride height requirements for street cars.[1][4]\nThe 962 Le Mans uses nearly the same engine as the racing 962: Porsche's water-cooled Type-935 2994 cc Flat-6 with two K\u00fchnle, Kopp und Kausch AG turbochargers.[1] Since the road car did not have to meet racing regulations, the air restrictor was removed allowing for an output of approximately 730\u00a0hp (544\u00a0kW). The 5-speed racing gearbox was also retained.[1]\nThe drivetrain also stood the same, being rear-wheel-drive.\nA top speed of 251.4\u00a0mph (404.6\u00a0km/h) was independently measured in 1998. Other performance figures included a 0-62.1\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in 2.8 seconds\nand 0-124.3\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) in 7.3 seconds. \nThe Dauer 962 was called the 'fastest street-legal production car in the world' in the Evo September 2003 issue.[5] It was succeeded by the Bugatti Veyron which reached 253.81\u00a0mph (408.47\u00a0km/h) in 2007.[6]\nFollowing rule changes in the World Sportscar Championship in 1992 which saw Porsche 962 numbers dwindle in Europe, including at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Porsche was looking for ways to continue their sports car efforts. Although 962s were still legal at Le Mans, the cars were subjected to newer technical regulations that negatively effected their performance, subsequently ceasing to be competitive against the current top entrants in its class.\nWith the re-introduction of production-based grand tourer-style cars in 1993, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) had created a loophole[3] as no specific number of road-going examples was established within its homologation requirements. With Dauer's success in modifying a Porsche 962 into a street-legal car in 1993, Porsche saw an opportunity to bring the 962 back into competition.[3]\nWith the first production car shown to the public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules.[7] Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (now up to 120 litres),[3] and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.\nThe flat bottom and narrow tires of the 962 Le Mans would hinder the performance of the car over the long laps at Le Mans even with the increased power from the GT-class air restrictor. However Porsche believed that the larger fuel tank they were allowed in the GT-class would allow them to overcome this lack of speed by spending less time in the pits than the Group C cars, something which is key for an endurance race.\nA total of two Dauer 962 Le Mans racing cars were built. Arriving at Le Mans with the support of Porsche's factory racing team, Joest Racing,[7] Dauer's two cars showed that they lacked the overall pace of the top Group C cars by qualifying fifth and seventh. However their pace in their class was shattering as the next closest GT1-class car could only muster 12th. The race saw Porsche's plan pan out, as the Dauer 962 Le Mans were able to gradually make their way to the top of the standings while their competitors spent time in the pits or succumbed to mechanical woes. In the end, only a lone Toyota 94C-V in the Group C class could contend with the Dauers, taking second place overall. The Dauer 962 Le Mans of Yannick Dalmas, Hurley Haywood, and Mauro Baldi would take the overall win while the second team car would finish one lap behind in third place overall.[7]\nSoon after this event the ACO attempted to fix the loophole in the GT regulations by setting a minimum requirement for production cars to meet homologation standards.[4] With this, the Dauer 962s would never race again, nor would the normal Porsche 962s as the Group C class was finally abandoned.\n", "Porsche Junior": "Porsche Junior is a tractor manufactured by Porsche-Diesel from 1952 to 1963. It is  powered by an air-cooled 14 hp 822 cc, single-cylinder diesel engine.\n Media related to Porsche-Diesel Junior at Wikimedia Commons\n", "Kremer CK5": "The Porsche 936 was a Group 6 Two-Seater Racing Car introduced in 1976 by Porsche as a delayed successor to the 917, a five litre Group 5 Sports Car, and the 908, a three litre Group 6 Prototype-Sports Car, both of which were retired by the factory after 1971. Its name came from using a variant of the Porsche 930's turbocharged engine, as well as competing in Group 6 racing.\nThe Porsche 936 was built to compete in the World Sportscar Championship as well as at 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans under the Group 6 formula, which it won both of. Chassis 002 with #20 won with Jacky Ickx and Gijs van Lennep won Le Mans, while the #18 chassis 001 of Reinhold Joest and J\u00fcrgen Barth had engine failure. It shared these victories with its production-based sibling, the Porsche 935 which won in Group 5. The open top, two seater spyder was powered by an air-cooled, two-valve 540\u00a0hp (403\u00a0kW) single-turbocharger flat-6 engine with 2140 cc, or the equivalent of 3000 cc including the 1.4 handicap factor. The spaceframe chassis was based on the 917, with many of the parts also coming from the car. In the first outings, the Martini Racing car was still black,[1] and the engine cover behind the roll bar was flat. The large hump and the air box above the engine was fitted onto the car later in the season. It is not for the air intake of the turbocharged engine, nor for cooling of the air-cooled engine itself, but instead mainly used for the intercooler.\nFrom 1976 to 1981, the factory entered Porsche 936 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times with Jacky Ickx ('76, '77, '81), thus each of the three original chassis won once. In 1978, the two previously winning chassis, which had been updated for 1977, came second and third behind the Renault, while the pole-setting new chassis 003 crashed out. Porsche did not intend to sell the 936 to customers, wanting them instead to use the 935 (which occupied the first four places at Le Mans in 1979), and the old 908 which were still around, updated to turbo engines and new 936-like aerodynamics. In 1979, a half-hearted Essex-sponsored Le Mans entry with two 936 was a failure, and the car also crashed[2] at Silverstone. Porsche, wanting to test a new engine for the 956 pulled a few 936's out of the Porsche museum in Stuttgart, redesigned the car to create the 936/81 and entered as 2 official works entries for the 1981 Le Mans 24 Hours, coaxing Jacky Ickx out of retirement, and at the Belgian's request having Briton Derek Bell as his teammate for the race, which needless to say they won, with the Mass/Barth/Haywood sister car retiring. Porsche engineers provided some unofficial support to very good customers, though, and Joest managed to get a spare chassis (004) and parts to assemble a car which was in 1980 designated as Porsche 908/80 and entered privately by Joest Racing. The Martini Racing Liqui Moly backed car took second at Le Mans in 1980. Kremer received blueprints to recreate a modified '81-spec car dubbed chassis 005 for 1982.\nThe successor Porsche 956 was introduced in 1982 after the new 2650 cc engine designed for Indycar was tested in the 1981 winning chassis 003 which was sponsored by Jules,  a Christian Dior fragrance for men. At the inaugural year of the new Group C formula which the 956 was built for, privateer teams such as Kremer Racing and Joest Racing had to wait until 1983 for their 956. Thus, in an attempt to conform to the new Group C regulations, both teams built new bodyshapes that incorporated a roof onto their 936-replicas. Joest's car was designated as 936C JR005 while Kremer's car became known as the CK5 01.\n", "Kremer K8 Spyder": "The Kremer K8 Spyder, along with its predecessor, the K7 (1992-1993), were open-cockpit prototypes built by Kremer Racing for use in multiple sportscar series, such as the IMSA GT Championship, Interserie, and International Sports Racing Series. The cars shared many components from the retired Porsche 962 and would eventually go on to win the 24 Hours of Daytona and several championships.\nDuring 1992, Kremer Racing had abandoned the World Sportscar Championship due to heavy costs brought on by the new engine formula which had gone into effect in 1991. The racing company therefore turned to the smaller Interserie championship, which continued to allow Kremer's 962CK6s to compete alongside a wide variety of machinery. However, teams in the Interserie at the time were opting more and more for open-cockpit Formula One or CART-based machines with bodywork attached to them for more downforce. This left the closed-cockpit prototypes like the 962CK6 at a disadvantage due to their heavier weight.  Kremer Racing, as well as other teams in the series, chose to therefore turn their coup\u00e9s into open-cockpit cars in an attempt to lower weight and increase speed.\nKremer initially took one of their existing 962CK6s and began extensive modifications to the bodywork.  The roof and windshield of the cockpit was removed, while the doors were replaced with new bodywork to surround the open cockpit.  This bolstering of the side bodywork moved the driver to a more central position, similar to an open-wheel formula car.  Because of the elimination of the doors, the large intakes on either side of the cockpit were also reshaped, with a large cut made to allow air to flow in from the side of the car.  \nThe engine cover was retained in order to give the driver rollover protection as well as to maintain some of the 962CK6's original aerodynamics.  Underneath the bodywork, most of the mechanicals of the 962 were retained, including the Type-935 3.2 litre Flat-6 engine.  These cars became known as the Kremer K7 Spyder, with at least two built specifically for Interserie use.\nFollowing on the success of the K7s in Interserie use, Kremer saw the opportunity to adapt their design to the new open-cockpit formulas that were being allowed in the IMSA GT Championship and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Once again, the 962CK6s were used as a base, although some styling elements were changed between the CK7 and the new K8 Spyder in order to conform to the rules used in these events.\nThe K8s would be required to maintain their two-seater layout as had been used on the 962CK6s.  This meant that the large bodywork replacing the doors was replaced with a much lower design which incorporated a windshield.  The rules also necessitated the addition of a rollbar to the top of the engine cover, to better protect a driver's head in the event of a rollover.  Also, to meet engine requirements, Kremer chose to use a smaller variant of the Type-935 Flat-6, running only a 3.0 litre displacement.  The large snorkels for feeding the turbochargers were also replaced with a more discreet inlet.  At least three K8 Spyders were built by Kremer during their use.\nThe initial K7 made its debut during the 1992 Interserie season.  Running alongside an unmodified 962CK6, the K7 was able to perform well in its first event at the N\u00fcrburgring on 17 May, winning one heat and finishing second overall before going on to win the Brands Hatch event overall on July 26th.  The K7 would go on to take victories at Zolder Circuit and Autodrom Most, leading to Kremer Racing winning the team's championship and Manuel Reuter winning the driver's championship.\nFor 1993, a second K7 would be completed, replacing the older 962CK6.  The team would immediately show their dominance in the series, finishing in first and second place at Jarama.  Both cars would have top three finishes for the rest of the season until the final round when a lone K7 would suffer problems and finish in seventh.  With four wins on the season, Giovanni Lavaggi was able to win the driver's championship, but Kremer would ultimately finish second to S.C.I. in the team's championship.\nIn 1994, Kremer concentrated solely on the development of the new K8 Spyder for its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Backed by Gulf Oil sponsorship, the K8 Spyder would be the only open-cockpit car competing in the LMP1/C90 class.  The design proved its speed by qualifying second on the grid alongside a Courage-Porsche.  Driver's Derek Bell, Robin Donovan, and J\u00fcrgen L\u00e4ssig would run towards the top of the field for most of the race, but eventually they finished the race in sixth, nearly thirty laps behind the winning Dauer 962.\nAfter Le Mans, Kremer Racing chose to prove the endurance capabilities of the K8 again by entering the car into the IMSA GT Championship debut event of the 1995 season, the 24 Hours of Daytona.  Although the car did not qualify well, the driving team of Giovanni Lavaggi, J\u00fcrgen L\u00e4ssig, Marco Werner, and Christophe Bouchut were eventually able to take the race victory by five laps over the nearest competitor.  The team followed to the next event, the 12 Hours of Sebring, but the K8 suffered mechanical problems and finished a distant 30th place.  \nThe team therefore returned to Europe, where the second K8 was now completed and waiting competition.  Both cars were entered in Le Mans once again.  Now in a field full of open-cockpit prototypes, the K8s faced stiffer competition from the likes of Courage and the new custom-built Ferrari 333 SP.  One K8 would muster only a fifth place qualifying spot, which the team was eventually able to turn into a sixth place finish.  The second car lacked pace for most of the race and eventually withdrew with electrical problems.  After Le Mans, Kremer chose to finish the year in Interserie once again, using a CK7 in two of the final three rounds, earning themselves a sole victory.\nFor 1996, Kremer began to concentrate more on the new BPR Global GT Series, running Porsche 911 GT2s.  However, two K8 were once again brought out for Le Mans following slight evolutions to their bodywork.  The age of the cars led to them slipping further down in qualifying, managing to only make 13th.  During the race, both cars failed to finish: One due to an accident and the other suffering an engine failure.  The team would perform even worse in 1997, when one of two cars failed to qualify for the race.  The lone entry dropped out of the event in the first half with an engine failure.\nHowever, the K8 saw regular competition once again during 1997.  The team would enter into the 1000km Monza victory for John Nielsen and Thomas Bscher.  After Le Mans, the team would enter the new International Sports Racing Series.  Two K8s would compete in the final round of the series' debut season, earning third and seventh places.  For the next year, the two evolved cars would be entered in the full season.  The season opener would see the best result for the K8 with a second place, with the team eventually finishing in eighth place in the team's championship.  A lone K8 would also again be entered at Le Mans, where the evolved car was able to improve on its previous performances by finishing in 12th, yet second in the LMP1 class.\n1999 would be the final year of competition for the K8 Spyders, as Kremer Racing purchased a new Lola B98/10 for use in the ISRS.  However, before their Lola was completed, the team used a K8 in the first two rounds of the season and finishing ninth in one of the events.  A second K8 was sold to the privateer Dutch team BPR Competition who had success early in the season, but eventually withdrew from the series.\n", "Porsche LMP1-98": "The Porsche WSC-95 (sometimes referred to as the TWR WSC-95) was a Le Mans Prototype originally built by Tom Walkinshaw Racing. It was modified by Porsche from the original Group C Jaguar XJR-14 from which it derived,[1] and run by Joest Racing. Originally intended to race in the IMSA World Sportscar Championship, the WSC-95 saw very little race action even though it managed to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans in both 1996 and 1997 without being acknowledged as a factory supported project. It was later upgraded to the Porsche LMP1-98 before being retired. Only two cars were ever built.\nIn 1994, Porsche approved the beginning of a project to develop a prototype for the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) series, running under the World Sports Car (WSC) regulations. The car was not a factory-backed effort, yet was approved by Porsche and use some of their expertise and most of all their powerplant. Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) used the XJR-14 chassis number 691,[2] modified by Porsche.\nFor an engine, Porsche used one of their longest running motors, the Type-935 turbocharged Flat-6. Originally used in the Porsche 956 in the 1980s, the engine was still powerful enough to power modern prototypes. While Porsche's new 911 GT1s used a 3.2 Litre engine, the WSC-95 used a smaller 3.0 Litre engine. Although smaller, this gave the WSC-95 a better fuel economy than the 911 GT1, which was useful over long race distances.\nUnfortunately, the IMSA WSC regulations were changed prior to the 1995 season, leading to Porsche canceling the project.  However, in February 1996 Reinhold Joest of the Joest Racing team convinced Porsche to give the unused prototype to his team, and for them to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With approval from Porsche, Joest put forth the money to allow for the construction of a second car from scratch, as well as the slight modifications to the existing car in order to meet the Le Mans Prototype (LMP1) regulations. Porsche agreed to help in the development of the car only if Joest agreed to pay for the services.\nFollowing the success of the WSC-95s in winning both the 1996 and 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans, Porsche decided to take over the project themselves. Both WSC-95 chassis underwent major revisions to their bodywork. The nose was raised in the middle, while to the sides sculpting allowed for the moving of the air intakes for the engine, necessitating the removal of the large scoop underneath the rollbar. The sides of the car were also redesigned, with the large opening for the radiator vents covered up while exhaust vents were also rearranged. The Type-935 Flat-6 was also upgraded, expanded out to 3.2 Litres. Having become a proper factory undertaking, the cars became officially known as the Porsche LMP1-98s.\nThe two WSC-95s were completed just in time for Joest Racing to go to the Le Mans test session in May. There, the two cars showed their pace early by setting the fifth and tenth fastest times, easily beating the factory Porsche 911 GT1s. A few weeks later at Le Mans, the WSC-95s showed their improvements and the #8 entry was at the pole position, while #7 was seventh. However the 911 GT1s had also improved, taking the fourth and fifth fastest qualifying positions. During the race, the #7 WSC-95 led for nearly the entire race, although closely followed by the factory 911 GT1s. The #8 entry remained towards the front as well, although it succumbed to mechanical failures caused by a collision on the track during the closing hours. In the end, the #7 entry of Davy Jones, Alexander Wurz, and Manuel Reuter took the overall victory, a mere lap ahead of the following Porsche 911 GT1.\nAlthough Joest had originally intended to run the car just at Le Mans in 1996, the team decided to attempt once again in 1997 with a single car. A few weeks prior to Le Mans, Joest decided to showcase their car at the inaugural International Sports Racing Series event at Donington Park, where the car took a dominant victory. Upon returning to Le Mans they still showed their pace by once again taking pole position. Although still facing competition from the factory Porsche 911 GT1s as well as the new McLaren F1 GTRs, Nissan had now entered and were keen to take an overall victory. However, unlike the previous year, the 911 GT1s suffered various difficulties, both in the hands of the factory team but also for the privateers. The finish therefore came down to a close race between a McLaren F1 GTR and the WSC-95, with Joest Racing once again coming out the victor by a single lap. Ferrari Formula One team mates of 1985 and 1986, Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson, drove with Le Mans rookie Tom Kristensen to take the win. It was the first of a record nine wins at Le Mans for Kristensen.\nNow realizing the potential of the abandoned WSC-95 against their 911 GT1, Porsche developed both chassis into the newer and even more capable LMP1-98. Unfortunately at the same time, not only were Porsche attempting to improve both the 911 GT1 and LMP1-98, but as were Nissan and the newcomers Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Still run by the Joest Racing squad, the LMP1-98s showed that their quick pace was now lacking against new competitors, managing to take a best of only ninth in qualifying. During the race itself, although the LMP1-98s showed pace, they were not able to survive the entire race. One car suffered electronics difficulties after only 107 laps, while the second car broke some bodywork mountings in a spin and was not able to continue after it had completed 218 laps.\nFor a final appearance, an LMP1-98 appeared at the debut Petit Le Mans in the United States. Alongside a lone 911 GT1, both cars showed great pace, but the LMP1-98 had to settle for second place, defeated by a custom Ferrari 333 SP by only a few seconds following ten hours of racing.\nThe LMP1-98s were retired after 1998, with Porsche planning to develop their own Le Mans Prototype for 2000. That project was later cancelled, and Porsche did not return to factory prototype racing until the 2005 debut of the Porsche RS Spyder.\nWSC-95 #001\nWSC-95 #002\n", "Porsche Macan": "The Porsche Macan (Type 95B) is a five-door luxury crossover SUV (CUV) produced by the German car manufacturer Porsche from 2014. It is built in Leipzig, Germany.\nThe Macan range includes many variants, including the Macan, Macan S, Macan S Diesel, Macan GTS and the Macan Turbo.\nThe Macan was originally known by its code name Cajun, a portmanteau of Cayenne Junior (not to be confused with Porsche-Diesel Junior tractor).[1]  On February 16, 2012 Porsche announced the final name for the car to be Macan. This is the Javanese word for tiger.\nInitially announced in November 2010 as a development project,[2] and formally announced by Porsche in March 2011, the 'Macan' model name was decided in 2012.[3]\nMacan was unveiled in 2013 Los Angeles Auto Show[4] and 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.[5]\nEuropean models went on sales in spring 2014.[6]\nEarly models included Macan S, Macan Turbo.[7]\nUS models arrived at U.S. dealerships in late spring 2014 as 2015 model year vehicle. Early models included Macan S, Macan Turbo.[8]\nAt launch, three different models and engines were available, all being V6 format:[9] a 3.0-litre Macan S with 340\u00a0PS (250\u00a0kW; 335\u00a0bhp), a 3.6-litre Macan Turbo with 400\u00a0PS (294\u00a0kW; 395\u00a0bhp) and a 3.0-litre 258\u00a0PS (190\u00a0kW; 254\u00a0bhp) Diesel, with a CO2 emissions of 159 g/km. The Macan GTS was announced in October 2015 to fit into the gap between the Macan S and Macan Turbo.\nAll Macans feature a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive, with several options available including air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM).\nPorsche subsequently released a base Macan for select Asian markets and the United Kingdom. Using a reworked version of the Volkswagen Group's 2.0-litre inline-four engine used in multiple applications such as the Audi Q5, the Macan is the first Porsche to be powered by four cylinders since the Porsche 968. This engine became offered globally for the Macan's 2017 model year following an announcement in March 2016. A 204\u00a0PS (150\u00a0kW; 201\u00a0bhp) 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel is due to join the range at a later date.[10]\nThe Macan S has a 0\u201360 miles per hour (0\u201397\u00a0km/h) time of 5.2 seconds and the Macan Turbo 4.6 seconds.[11]  Both times are improved by 0.2 sec when employing Launch Control (feature of the optional \"Sport Chrono\" package).[12]\nRear Seat Entertainment system became available in 2015.[13]\nThe Porsche Macan shares its platform with the Audi Q5.[15][16] The wheelbase and suspension configuration are based on and heavily modified from the Audi,[citation needed] but the engine, transfercase, suspension tuning, interior and exterior are unique to Porsche for the Macan. It is also 1.7 inches (43\u00a0mm) longer and 1.4 inches (36\u00a0mm) wider than a Q5.[17]\nThe Macan is produced alongside the Panamera and the Cayenne in Leipzig, Germany in a newly extended factory.[18] The Macan compact crossover SUV offers a more compact body than the Cayenne midsize crossover SUV. The Macan is also intended to be sportier than the Cayenne; for instance the Macan has a standard 7-speed dual-clutch PDK gearbox which is more responsive while the Cayenne has an 8-speed Tiptronic transmission for smoother shifts.[19][16]\nChanges to Macan include Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, optional full-LED headlights, redesigned steering controller, extended exterior and interior packages for Macan Turbo.\nMacan GTS was unveiled in 2015 Tokyo Motor Show.\nThe vehicles went on sale at Porsche dealers in early 2016, with ordering began in Germany in 2015.[20]\nUnveiled at the 2016 New York International Auto Show, the base Macan joined the range with an inline-four turbocharged 2.0-litre engine, matte black window surrounds, brake calipers in black, unique dual exhaust pipes in stainless steel, front fascia and lava black side blades from the Macan S, seat centres in Alcantara, the newest generation of Porsche Communication Management (PCM), Piano Black interior package and a lane departure warning system.\nThe four-cylinder model went on sale in the United States and globally as a 2017 model year vehicle, with deliveries beginning in July 2016.[21]\nAs of 2017-06-03, Porsche Cars North America Inc. announced 1,871 Macans were delivered with 1,071 Macans sold at the month, and 7,060 sold at year to date.[22]\n", "Porsche P1": "\nThe Porsche P1, otherwise known as the Egger-Lohner electric vehicle, C.2 Phaeton model, is the world's first Porsche. It is designed by Ferdinand Porsche and is considered to be the first stepping stone for him before he and his son created the company,  Porsche. The vehicle resembles a wooden crate or an old horse-drawn carriage but it is actually an electrically motored vehicle.[1]\nThe C.2 Phaeton model is in fact a four seat vehicle which is powered by the \"octagon\" electric motor, which took its name from the eight-sided design of the motor housing. The electric motor can produce an output of 3\u00a0hp at 350rpm and for short periods of time, up to 5\u00a0hp with a top speed of 35\u00a0km/h by overcharging it. The car could be driven for three to five hours with a range of approximately 49 miles. The car uses a complicated series of gears where it is driven by using a 12-speed controller where six are dedicated to forward gears, two for reverse and four to brake the car.\nThe vehicle can also be styled as an open-air chassis or a coupe and because of its alternating vehicle body, it could be used during the summer and winter or sunny and rainy days. The vehicle is mainly made out of wood and weighs 2977 pounds with the battery itself weighing over 1103 pounds. The wheels are also made out of wood and are surrounded with pneumatic tires.\nThe car have disappeared for 112 years and have only recently been found in a warehouse in Austria, where it had remained untouched since 1902.[2] The car remains to be in a clean and good condition where the motor still functions, however the batteries and seats have gone missing. It is currently on display at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.\nIn the year 1898,  Ferdinand Porsche designed his first ever car and named it the Egger-Lohner electric vehicle, C.2 Phaeton model or \"P1\" for short. The short form of the car \"P1\" came from Ferdinand Porsche who made sure that he would be credited for his design and work of the vehicle, hence he engraved the code \"P1\" which stood for Porsche number 1, onto all of the key components of the vehicle. The P1 was originally created for a car maker company by the name of Jacob Lohner. Ludwig Lohner, the owner of Jacob Lohner became convinced after seeing Ferdinand Porsche that the age of horse and carriage was over, requested Ferdinand Porsche to create an electric drive train. On June 26, 1898, the P1 officially rolled out to the streets of Vienna, Austria. On September 28, 1899, Ferdinand Porsche entered the Berlin road race with the P1, where it won the gold medal and crossed the finish line 18 minutes before the second car did. With such shocking results from the P1, it had also won another title where the P1 came out on top in the efficiency test, where it is recorded as the lowest energy consumption vehicle in urban traffic.[3]\n", "Porsche Panamera": "The Porsche Panamera is a luxury 4-door saloon manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche.[1][2][3] It is front-engined and has a rear-wheel-drive layout, with all-wheel drive versions also available. It is the only saloon manufactured by Porsche as part of its strategy of expanding its market.\nThe production version of the Porsche Panamera was unveiled at the 13th Auto Shanghai International Automobile Show in Shanghai, China, on April 2009.[4] In 2011, hybrid and diesel versions were launched. In April 2013, a facelift to the Panamera was announced, making its debut again at the Shanghai Auto Show.[5] A plug-in hybrid version, the Panamera S E-Hybrid, was released in the U.S. market in November 2013.[6] The Panamera range received a re-design in 2016.\nThe Panamera's name is derived, like the Porsche Carrera lineage, from the Carrera Panamericana race. The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's 989 concept vehicle from the late 1980s.\nLike the Porsche Cayenne SUV (which has become the marque's best-selling vehicle), the Panamera upset many Porsche purists, since it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond that of hardcore fans. The Panamera ran contrary to the company's signature offerings, particularly its light two-door rear-engine sports cars like the 911. The Panamera on the other hand is considered a full-size luxury car, weighing nearly 4,000 pounds (1,800\u00a0kg), with four doors, and its engine mounted in the front. The Panamera's appearance with its long hood and rear hatch bears resemblance to a stretched 911.[7] The iconic 911 has a sparse interior, as it was focused on raw performance, while the Panamera has a sumptuous interior loaded with modern technological amenities and expensive leather upholstery.[8][9]\nEngines are first assembled in Stuttgart, and the car's body is built, painted and  assembled in Leipzig, Germany, alongside the Cayenne and Macan.[10] From 2009 to 2016, the bodies were built at the Volkswagen Group facility in Hannover.[11]\nProduction began in April 2009, one month after its debut in the Shanghai Motor Show in China.[12]\nThe V8-powered Panamera S, 4S, and Turbo models were the first versions that debuted in 2009. In addition to the 4.8L Twin Turbo 507\u00a0PS (373\u00a0kW; 500\u00a0hp) V8 powered models, Porsche launched two further models in 2010: the Panamera and Panamera 4 which are both powered by 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6 engines producing 304\u00a0PS (224\u00a0kW; 300\u00a0hp).\nBeing derived from the V8 engine of the Panamera S and Panamera 4S, the V6 retains the V8's technologies like Direct Fuel Injection, infinitely variable intake camshaft adjustment with variable valve lift (VarioCam Plus), an on-demand oil pump, water cooling with thermal management, a variable intake manifold, as well as integrated dry sump lubrication with two-stage extraction of oil, and an Auto Start-Stop function (only with the PDK transmission).[16] Turbo version uses active aerodynamics with a multi-stage, adjustable rear spoiler.[17] Optional Sports Chrono Packages include a Sport Plus button, which has tighter damping and air springs, and lowers the car's body by 25\u00a0mm (1.0\u00a0in).[18]\nIn 2011, the Panamera S Hybrid,[19] Diesel,[20] Turbo S,[21] and GTS variants were added to the range. The GTS achieves a lateral acceleration of 0.96g.[22]\nThe Panamera, S, Hybrid and Diesel models are rear-wheel drive, while the Panamera 4, 4S, and GTS have the same four-wheel drive system as the Turbo and Turbo S, called Porsche Traction Management (PTM).\nThe Panamera featured Adaptive air suspension, the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), active anti-roll bars[23] and the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM).\nThe newly introduced ZF 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission was standard on the Panamera 4, 4S and Turbo models.[24][25] \nThe addition of the optional sport chrono package provided faster acceleration times. In some markets a 6-speed manual was available for rear-wheel drive petrol versions.  The S Hybrid and Diesel models had an Aisin-supplied eight-speed automatic transmission called the Tiptronic S.\nThe engine of the Panamera Turbo S features larger turbochargers than the standard Panamera Turbo\u2019s 4.8-litre V8, as well as high-pressure fuel injection, and aluminium-alloy pistons. The piston rings are coated in a low-friction surface to help eke out even more performance. The Panamera Turbo S accelerates to 62\u00a0mph in 3.8 seconds with launch control engaged. Roll-on acceleration should be more impressive, changes to the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) gearbox allow for faster gearshifts, and the alleged 27.7mpg fuel economy is no worse than the less powerful Panamera Turbo.[26]\nIn 2008, Porsche AG announced the development of a parallel hybrid system for the Panamera,[28] and in February 2011, Porsche unveiled the Panamera S Hybrid. Using the same drivetrain seen in the Cayenne S Hybrid\u2014an Audi-sourced[29] supercharged 3.0-litre V6 engine producing 333\u00a0PS (245\u00a0kW; 328\u00a0hp) along with an electric motor rated at 47\u00a0PS (35\u00a0kW; 46\u00a0hp), as well as the Cayenne's 8-speed Tiptronic S transmission\u2014the 380\u00a0PS (279\u00a0kW; 375\u00a0hp) Panamera S Hybrid could accelerate from 0\u201362\u00a0mph in 6.0\u00a0seconds. The Panamera S Hybrid produced only 193\u00a0grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre, rendering it the most environment friendly car in the then entire Porsche model range,[30] while still maintaining a top speed of 167.8\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h).\nDeliveries began in the United States in 2011, and cumulative sales reached 684 units through March 2013.[31][32] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the fuel economy for the 2013/2012 model year Panamera Hybrid at 22\u00a0mpg\u2011US (11\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 26\u00a0mpg\u2011imp) for city driving, 30\u00a0mpg\u2011US (7.8\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 36\u00a0mpg\u2011imp) for highway, and 25\u00a0mpg\u2011US (9.4\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 30\u00a0mpg\u2011imp) combined.[33]\nThe Panamera Diesel was launched in May 2011. The vehicle utilised the same Audi 3.0L V6 engine used in the Cayenne Diesel, which was itself a tuned carryover of an existing engine. The engine had a power output of 250\u00a0PS (184\u00a0kW; 247\u00a0hp). The car was capable of accelerating from 0\u201362&nbspmph in 6.8 seconds and had a top speed of 150.4\u00a0mph (242\u00a0km/h). It was also the most economical Porsche in the then entire Porsche vehicle lineage, consuming just 6.3 litres per 100 kilometres (37 US MPG/45 UK MPG).\nIn October 2012, Porsche introduced the Panamera Platinum Edition. The exterior of the Panamera Platinum Edition was enveloped in one of five basic colours \u2013 black, white, basalt black, carbon grey metallic, and mahogany metallic. It included more standard equipment, larger wheels, and an exclusive interior leather combination of luxor beige and black. It was be offered with rear and all wheel drive layouts, and had a 0 to 60\u00a0mph (0 to 97\u00a0km/h) acceleration time of under 5.8\u00a0seconds or faster on all variants. Exclusive equipment included the special interior combination, platinum rear overhang and front lower grille, platinum door sills, and platinum mirrors. The finalizing touch to this special edition included an exclusive set of 19-inch Panamera Turbo alloy wheels with the red, black, and gold Porsche crest. \nIn March 2015, Porsche announced that they were releasing a new special edition Panamera called the \"Panamera Edition\". The car is based on the base Panamera and  includes high-gloss black trim strips outline the windows,19-inch Panamera Turbo wheels with coloured centre caps, the sills were inscribed with the word \"Edition,\" and body-coloured door handles were an  additional add on when the customer chose the Porsche Entry & Drive option. The Panamera Edition cost 80,000 USD.\nPorsche announced its updated Panamera on 3 April 2013, with a scheduled formal launch at Auto Shanghai. The revised model can be identified by new front and rear bumpers. Technical changes included the addition of a new 3.0L twin-turbocharged Panamera S and a new E-Hybrid model. A long wheelbase version with an additional 150\u00a0mm was available for selected left-hand drive markets. The Turbo S version followed up in 2014. The long wheelbase versions were only available on 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S models.[34]\nAs part of the 2013 Panamera facelift, Porsche announced the introduction of a plug-in hybrid model, the Panamera S E-Hybrid. The plug-in version was unveiled at the April 2013 Shanghai Auto Show.[36][37] The S E-Hybrid is powered by a 71\u00a0kW (97\u00a0PS; 95\u00a0bhp) electric motor, with a total system power of 310\u00a0kW (421\u00a0PS; 416\u00a0bhp). Top speed amounted to 84\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in all-electric mode, and acceleration from 0\u201362mph took 5.8 seconds. The plug-in electric hybrid had a 9.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack capable of delivering a range of more than 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. The battery could be fully charged in approximately 2\u00bd hours from a 240 V power source. The Panamera plug-in hybrid reduce fuel consumption to 3.1\u00a0L/100\u00a0km (91\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 76\u00a0mpg\u2011US), down from 7.11\u00a0L/100\u00a0km (39.7\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 33.1\u00a0mpg\u2011US) for the current Panamera hybrid, which translates to CO2 emissions of 71 g/km, down from 167 g/km for the current hybrid.[36][37]\nIn November 2013, the UK Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) approved the eligibility of the Panamera S E-Hybrid for the Plug-in Car Grant which entitles customers to a maximum purchase subsidy of GB\u00a35,000 ( ~ US$8,000). The plug-in hybrid was rated with a fuel economy of 91\u00a0mpg\u2011imp (3.1\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 76\u00a0mpg\u2011US) and CO2 emissions of 71 g/km.[38]\nThe Panamera S E-Hybrid was released in the European market during the fourth quarter of 2013. Retail deliveries began in the U.S. in October 2013.[6] As of  December\u00a02013[update], a total of 90 units were delivered in France,[40] 86 units in the United States,[41] 59 units in the Netherlands,[42] 14 in Spain,[43] and about 12 in Germany.[44]\nIn the American market the 2014 model year price starts at US$99,000 before any applicable government incentives.[45] Since its introduction, 698 Panamera S E-Hybrids have been sold in the United States through August 2014.[46] Global sales between January and August 2014 totaled over 1,500 units, presenting 9% of all Panamera models sold worldwide and 1.3% of all Porsche vehicles sold during this period.[47]\nThe second generation Panamera was revealed on 28 June 2016 at a special event in Berlin, Germany. Codenamed 971,[48] it is 35\u00a0mm (1.4\u00a0in) longer, 5\u00a0mm (0.2\u00a0in) wider and 5\u00a0mm (0.2\u00a0in) taller than the first generation Panamera, with a 30\u00a0mm (1.2\u00a0in) longer wheelbase. The interior features a redesigned dashboard layout, with touch-sensitive surfaces replacing the previous generation\u2019s array of buttons. A centrally mounted tachometer also harks back to the 1955 Porsche 356 A.\nThe new car includes two seven-inch displays in place of the dials, as well as a 12.3-inch touchscreen featuring online sat-nav, Apple CarPlay integration and an updated voice control system. Under the bonnet is a new engine range, with only the Panamera 4S, 4S Diesel and flagship Turbo[49] available from launch. \n[50]\nIn March 2017, Porsche unveiled the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid for the 2018 model year. The Turbo S E-Hybrid will receive the 4.0 L V8 engine from the Panamera Turbo, but will also be paired with an electric motor. Total system power will be 680\u00a0PS (500\u00a0kW; 671\u00a0bhp), which makes it the second most powerful Porsche ever, after the 918 Spyder.[51]\nIn August 2017, Panamera 4S Diesel and Panamera Sport Turismo 4S Diesel were deleted from Porsche's German website and configurator. The German automotive magazine, auto motor und sport, discovered the higher than permittable amount, which is one-and-half times more than legal limit, during the exhaust testing.[52] The issue was with SCR catalysator and urea injection. Porsche plans to reintroduce the diesel engine when the technical workaround is developed.\nThe new Panamera no longer has its predecessor's oft-criticized, elephantine hatchback wagon styling, with the tail of the vehicle developing a clear link to the Porsche 911 through the full width rear LED light bar, and the sharply creased tail and upper bumper.[53] This improvement in design has helped clarify the model's identity as a sports-oriented GT car.[53]\nIn Europe a 5-door, shooting-brake estate variant, called the Sport Turismo, will be offered alongside the saloon. It will also be available in the United States.[54] The Panamera Sport Turismo debuted in March 2017 at the Geneva Motor Show, and is currently available with the same engine range as the 4-door car. In September 2017 Porsche announced the Panamera Turbo S e-Hybrid Sport Turismo, the 5-door estate version of the flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid, which had previously only been available as a 4-door configuration.[55] As of September 2017, the 680 PS (Metric horsepower) Panamera Turbo S e-Hybrid Sport Turismo is currently the world's most powerful stock estate car, besting the 612 PS Mercedes-AMG E 63 S and the 605 PS Audi RS6 Performance.[56]\nDespite the differences in dimensions and design, a reviewer noted that the Panamera's driving dynamics were close to that of the 911, and it \"seems to occupy the no-man's-land between really good sports sedans and proper sports cars\", and so far the Panamera has won every comparison test against other four-door performance cars on the market such as the Maserati Quattroporte and Aston Martin Rapide.[57][58] Function was also praised, with the 15.7 cubic feet (440\u00a0L) hatchback trunk, and the four-corner adaptive air suspension that retained superior handling while also providing a comfortable ride for public roads. Edmunds stated that the Panamera was an innovative engineering feat that \"makes a unique statement about the way that luxury transportation and serious high-performance potential can be mixed together in one car\".[8][9]\nUnlike most of the V8-engined contemporaries, all models of the Panamera avoid the US Gas Guzzler Tax. The V6-powered Panamera was also praised, as its smaller engine still retained respectable acceleration,[59] and as it had even better handling than its V8 siblings, due to the engine being lighter by 100\u00a0lb (45\u00a0kg) which gave the car better weight distribution.[60]\nHowever, CAR magazine of the U.K. described the S model as lacking sportiness, which they attributed to their test car's being \"about as oriented to comfort as it\u2019s possible to get\"[61] and called the Turbo model \"a missed opportunity on behalf of Porsche\" to be \"the world\u2019s first lightweight four seater\" as the top model weighs as much as an Audi S8.[62]\nThe 30 November 2008 edition of BBC's Top Gear featured a look at the Panamera in its news section, with the three presenters being very critical of the look. In the June 2009 edition, Richard Hammond and James May were seen driving the Panamera along the A30 in Devon, Great Britain. They were racing against a letter sent via Royal Mail between the Isles of Scilly and the Orkney Islands. Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the Porsche Panamera for an article with The Times newspaper and was quite critical.[63]\nAs of 2011, the largest national market was the United States with 6188 sold.[64]  Sales by cities: Los Angeles (890), New York (760), Hong Kong (300), Dubai (285), Tokyo (223), Munich (206), Moscow (203), Shanghai (188), Hamburg (117) and Berlin (108).[65]  Sales internationally by model variant: Panamera 4S (9394), Turbo (6171), S (4563) and V6 (2390\u2014introduced weeks earlier).[64]\nIn 2012, U.S. sales of the Panamera totaled 7614 and Canadian sales of the Panamera totaled 422.[66] In 2017, most of the Panameras sold in Northern Europe were hybrids.[67]\nOn 20 April 2007, a spy video of the Porsche Panamera became available on the Internet.[68]\nIn September 2008, Porsche released the first teaser image for the Panamera.[69] In early October 2008, an undisguised Panamera was captured on film in Busan, South Korea.[70]\nOn 28 November 2008, Porsche sent a mailer containing two photos of the Panamera which were labeled as \"the first official images of the Porsche Panamera\" with an invitation to have online access to via Porsche USA's website.[71]\nOn 19 April 2009, Porsche finally unveiled the Porsche Panamera sedan to the public at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show.[72]  One of the highlights of the Panamera's debut was fitting the car in the freight elevator of the Shanghai World Financial Center and sending it to the skyscraper's 94th floor.[73]\nAn estate version concept of the Panamera was introduced at the 2012 Paris Motor Show called Sport Turismo.[74] Powered by an advancement of Porsche's current hybrid system utilized in the Panamera S Hybrid, the Sport Turismo concept's new \"e-Hybrid\" system uses the 333-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-litre V6 and a 95-horsepower electric motor for 416 combined horses and a 30-kilometer electric range. As opposed to the current production system, this e-Hybrid setup prioritizes all-electric motivation unless the driver instructs the car otherwise. The Sport Turismo is technically a plug-in hybrid since the lithium-ion battery pack can be fully charged in as little as 2.5 hours when plugged into a wall outlet. Porsche declares that the combined powertrain is proficient for 0-62\u00a0mph acceleration in less than six seconds, and that the Sport Turismo can exceed 80\u00a0mph while running purely on electric power.[75]\n", "Porsche RSK": "The Porsche 718 is a racing car built by Porsche between 1957 and 1962.\nThe 718 was a development of the successful Porsche 550A with improvements being made to the body work and suspension. The car is a RennSport build with a wheelbase shorter (German 'Kurz') than typical of predecessors of the era and this led to the car being referred to as the RSK. It had a mid-engined layout and used the 142 horsepower (106\u00a0kW) 1.5-litre Type 547/3 quad-cam engine introduced in the 550A. The car made its racing debut at the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans driven by Umberto Maglioli and Edgar Barth. The car failed to finish the race due to an accident.\nIn 1958, the car finished first in class and third overall at Le Mans guided by Jean Behra and Hans Herrmann. Jean Behra also brought one of the cars home second at the Targa Florio. In 1959, the car, driven by Edgar Barth and Wolfgang Seidel, claimed overall victory at the Targa Florio. A 718 also won the European Hill Climb Championship in both 1958 and 1959.\nIn 1961 Masten Gregory and Bob Holbert piloted a 718/4 RS Spyder to a class win at Le Mans.\nInitially a two-seater 1.5-litre sports car, the 718 was adapted to compete in a number of different formulas and also evolved due to regulation changes.\nFor the 1960 season the FIA made changes to the regulation regarding the windscreen and cockpit size. These rules changes together with a larger (1.6-litre) Type 547/3 engine, developing 160 horsepower (120\u00a0kW) and a new double wishbone rear suspension brought about the RS\u00a060 model. The RS\u00a060 brought Porsche victory at the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring with a car driven by Hans Herrmann and Olivier Gendebien.  1960 also saw Porsche win the Targa Florio with Hans Herrmann being joined on the winner podium by Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill. The RS 60 also ensured that Porsche successfully defended their European Hill Climb Championship for the third year in a row.\nFor 1961 the model name was changed to \"RS 61\" although it was almost identical to the RS 60. An RS 61 won the European Hill Climb Championship.[2]\nA two-litre version, the W-RS was developed in 1961. Initially fitted with a 4-cylinder engine, the car was later fitted with an enlarged flat-8 air-cooled engine from the Porsche 804 Formula One car which was developed to produce 240 horsepower (180\u00a0kW).[3] A W-RS finished 8th at Le Mans in 1963. The W-RS continued Porsche's success in the European Hill Climb Championship with Edgar Barth claiming the title in 1963. Porsche would go on to win a European Hill Climb Championship every year until 1982, a total of 42 titles.\nThe W-RS continued racing until 1964 when it was replaced by the 904.\nA Coup\u00e9 version was developed from the RS 61. Initially fitted with a 4-cylinder engine, this car was also upgraded to an 8-cylinder F1 derived engine which produced 210 horsepower (160\u00a0kW).[4] The car was also fitted with disc brakes. A GTR Coup\u00e9 driven Jo Bonnier and Carlo Maria Abate won the 1963 Targa Florio making it three wins at the event for a 718 car.\nA new Formula Two for 1.5-litre engine cars was introduced in 1957. Due the central location of the steering box, the 718 was easily converted to single seater specification and Porsche made their F2 debut with victories at Reims[5] and AVUS[6] in 1958. In 1959 other RSK's were converted for single seater racing and at the XV B.A.R.C. '200' at Aintree in 1960 Porsche scored a 1\u20132\u20133 victory with Stirling Moss, Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill all in 718's.[7] The feat was repeated again later in the year at the race at Zeltweg, Austria.[8]\nFormula One switched to a 1.5-litre formula in 1961 and Porsche entered three 718's for Dan Gurney, Hans Herrmann and Jo Bonnier. Gurney scored three 2nd places (France, Italy and United States) taking him to 4th place in the Drivers' Championship. For 1962, Porsche entered a new car, the Porsche 804 in Formula One.\nCarel Godin de Beaufort, a privateer, entered a 718 in F1 between 1961 and 1964. He was killed driving his 718 during practice for the 1964 German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring.[9]\nPorsche 718 RS60 Spyder\nPorsche 718 RSK Spyder\nPorsche 718 W-RS Spyder\nPorsche 718 W-RS Spyder\n", "Porsche Super": "Porsche-Diesel Super is a tractor that was manufactured by Porsche between 1956 and 1963. \nIt is powered by an air-cooled, four-stroke, 2466 cc, three-cylinder diesel.\n Media related to Porsche-Diesel Super at Wikimedia Commons\n", "Porsche Type 12": "The Porsche Type 12  or \"Auto f\u00fcr Jedermann\" (car for everybody) is a German automobile project produced in 1931.\nThe Type 12 was designed by Ferdinand Porsche for Z\u00fcndapp. It featured the rounded styling then in vogue, typified by the Schl\u00f6rwagen, Tatra V570, Chrysler Airflow, Dymaxion car, Toyota AA, and KdF-Wagen (better known as the Volkswagen Type 1 or Beetle).[1]\nIt featured a five-cylinder radial engine at Z\u00fcndapp's insistence, rather than the flat four Porsche preferred.[2] It also used a swing axle rear suspension (invented by Edmund Rumpler). In 1932, three prototypes were running.[3] All of those cars were lost during World War II,[4] the last in a bombing raid in Stuttgart in 1945.\nThe Type 12 also served as one step in the development of the VW Type 1.\nA replica of the Type 12 is on display at the Museum Industrielkultur in N\u00fcrnberg.[5]\n\n", "Template:Porsche modern timeline": ""}
